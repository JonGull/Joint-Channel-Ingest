Okay.  So you may have a bit of trouble trying to make an online claim.  But there are other ways.\r\n16:17:32 Morgan Cooper: Could you try and help please as I have no money\r\n16:17:47 Paul: Do you have an email in case we get cut-off or I need to send you information?\r\n16:17:54 Morgan Cooper: Yes\r\n16:18:02 Morgan Cooper: morganskyecooper@gmail.com\r\n16:18:26 Paul: Thanks.  B<span>efore I can move on and help you.  We are a part of Citizens Advice and our records are confidential.  We only ask information that is relevant to your case.  Because we keep a record of your personal data so that someone else can help as well, we must request your consent to do this in the first place.  The same applies for any questions I ask about health and disability.  Do we have your consent?</span>\r\n16:18:52 Morgan Cooper: Yea\r\n16:18:55 Morgan Cooper: yes\r\n16:19:34 Morgan Cooper: I spoke to somebody before and they gave me a link to speak to you\r\n16:19:51 Paul: Thanks.  We can run a benefit check for you if you like?\r\n16:19:57 Morgan Cooper: yes please\r\n16:22:08 Paul: Okay.  A bit of information first.  t sounds like you will not be able to apply for Universal Credit online because you do not have the documents to prove your identity online.  So you can make a \'telephone application\' for Universal Credit by calling 0800 328 5644.\r\n16:22:27 Paul: Sorry, typo \'it\'\r\n16:23:03 Morgan Cooper: What about if I could get my national insurance number what would I do then\r\n16:23:55 Paul: We can give you more information.  Here is a link to our website with some information that could be useful on Universal Credit:  <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>Universal Credit - Citizens Advice</a></span>\r\n16:24:36 Paul: They can do a biographical check that may overcome the problem of not knowing your NI number.\r\n16:24:56 Paul: Shall we go-ahead with the benefit check?\r\n16:25:24 Morgan Cooper: Yes please\r\n16:26:20 Paul: Fine.  I have to ask questions that take around 10-minutes to do.  Is that alright? \r\n16:26:50 Morgan Cooper: Yes\r\n16:27:37 Paul: Fine.  First, can I ask your permission to put you down as willing to give feedback on the service.  Its a random check?\r\n16:27:48 Morgan Cooper: Yes\r\n16:28:28 Paul: Thanks. Here we go with the questions.  <span>Are you a UK citizen living in the UK?  How old are you? Do you have savings of £6,000 - £16,000? Do you currently receive any benefits? Do you have any disabilities?  Do you receive any other income? Do you have a partner? What is your postcode and first line of your address?</span>\r\n16:30:17 Morgan Cooper: I am a uk citizen and living in the uk I am 18 years old I do not have any savings I do not receive any benefits I have to go and get tested for Adhd I do not receive any income yes I have a partner my address is 131 perch avenue b375lx\r\n16:31:19 Paul: Thanks.  Do you live with your partner in the same household?\r\n16:31:28 Morgan Cooper: No I do not\r\n16:32:29 Paul: Thanks.  You live with your nan at the moments so you do not have a tenancy agreement and have to pay rent as if you moved into a flat?\r\n16:32:54 Morgan Cooper: My Nan wants me to start paying rent as I am 18 now\r\n16:34:16 Paul: Yes.  Unfortunately you can only get help with rent if you have a formal tenancy agreement and have a landlord.  Not an informal arrangement with family.\r\n16:35:11 Morgan Cooper: Yes my Nan has had 2 strokes and has a bleed on the brain so I am basically her carer\r\n16:35:23 Paul: But you can get £344 a month Universal Credit without help with housing costs.  You will get this amount living with your nan.\r\n16:35:42 Morgan Cooper: how do I do that then\r\n16:36:56 Paul: Okay.  You apply for Universal Credit on the number I gave you earlier and tell them at the beginning that you want to make a \'telephone claim\'.\r\n16:37:15 Paul: How many hours care do you give your nan please?\r\n16:37:42 Morgan Cooper: 24 hours a day I help with everything\r\n16:38:09 Paul: I see.  Thanks.  Does your nan receive any benefits?\r\n16:38:14 Morgan Cooper: Yes\r\n16:38:38 Morgan Cooper: Can I not apply online for it\r\n16:38:39 Paul: Can you tell me what your nan\'s benefits are?\r\n16:38:59 Morgan Cooper: I’m not sure what she gets\r\n16:41:56 Paul: Okay.  You can claim Universal Credit online, but you will reach a stage where you have to prove your identity (\'verify\') and you do not have the documents to do.  So when you get there you tick the box that says \'I can\'t do this online\'. You will then need to call the number 0800 328 5644 to say you can\'t prove your ID and they will call you back to do it over the phone.\r\n16:42:37 Morgan Cooper: Ok thanks\r\n16:44:35 Paul: It takes at least 5-weeks for the first payment of Universal Credit to get paid into your bank account.  But you can request an \'advance payment\' which gets paid within 3-working days.\r\n'

Will I need to make a new claim under universal credit or will it be housing benefit?\r\n16:09:01 Sabb: I\'m on high rate pip and esa\r\n16:10:53 Adam: If your partner was claiming UC and has moved out, she could continue her claim provided that she didn\'t move to a new local authority area. However, you would need to claim UC for support with your housing costs as you can\'t make a new claim for HB in your own name. Are you receiving Income Related ESA or Contribution Based ESA?\r\n16:11:30 Adam: Sorry, partner claiming HB\r\n16:12:35 Sabb: I\'m receiving contribution ESA\r\n16:14:25 Adam: In that case your ESA claim could continue if you claimed UC, but it would be fully taken into account as unearned income. This means that whatever you receive from ESA would be deducted from your UC amount £ for £. Your PIP would continue as normal and would not affect your UC. \r\n16:15:06 Sabb: Ah ok thanks.\r\n16:15:11 Sabb: 1 last question\r\n16:16:29 Adam: If you would like to check how much your UC would be, you can use an online benefit calculator. If you enter your information including your ESA amount, rent, etc, it will tell your your expected UC payment:\r\n16:16:30 Adam: <span><a href=""https://www.entitledto.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.entitledto.co.uk/</a></span>\r\n16:17:26 Sabb: I\'m wanting to put an application to buy my council house with a family member but my council states that my partner will remain on tenancy agreement until she contacts them. I don\'t have a forwarding address for her so I can I best deal with the application?\r\n16:20:15 Adam: Sorry, I can\'t really advise on that. You can contact our advice line on <span>0800 144 8848</span> during the opening hours 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday for help with this.

As the debts are in your name and you brothers friends are guarantors you are both joint and severally liable for the debts. You can find out further information regarding guarantor loans on the following link - <span><a href=""https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/guarantor-loan-debts.aspx"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/guarantor-loan-debts.aspx</a></span>\r\n15:59:49 You: So wouldnt a DRO cover the guarantor loans\r\n16:01:24 Jodie (FRN 617534): The debt could be included in the the DRO and your liability for the debt would be written off, however, the <span>creditor then may pursue the guarantor for the full debt.</span>\r\n16:01:52 You: Ok no worries\r\n16:01:56 You: What do I need to do\r\n16:02:45 Jodie (FRN 617534): There is certain eligibility criteria for a DRO. <span>Do you own any assets? For example, a property, car, savings or anything else of value?</span>\r\n16:03:15 You: No\r\n16:03:27 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>In order for me to provide you more accurate advice, can you tell me a bit more about your personal circumstances? Your employment status, housing type, who else lives with you?</span>\r\n16:04:05 You: I\'m a single mother of 2 children on universal credit\r\n16:04:12 You: Just me and my children\r\n16:04:33 Jodie (FRN 617534): Thankyou. <span>After you have paid for all your essential expenditure items (eg rent, council tax, fuel, water, groceries etc - but not payments to credit debts) how much money do you feel you have left?</span>\r\n16:05:47 You: Around 75 I think\r\n16:06:53 Jodie (FRN 617534): It would be worth doing a budget, <span>this will give you a breakdown of how much money you are earning and spending. Here is a link to our budget tool which will help you work out your budget.<br>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/budgeting/ </span>\r\n16:07:22 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>If you experiencing debt or financial difficulties, it is always important to make sure you are receiving all benefits to which you may be entitled. The following link takes you to a benefit calculator which will help you work out whether you are: <a href=""https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou</a></span>\r\n16:07:37 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Do you have any priority debts? Do you have arrears with Rent, Council Tax, Magistrate’s Court Fines, Tv Licence, Energy, Child Maintenance payments, Income Tax, National Insurance, VAT, Hire Purchase (for an essential item).https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-prioritise-your-debts</span><br> \r\n16:08:54 You: I\'ve just had a court letter for £1800 and there expecting me to pay £75 a month starting 27th may and cant afford it\r\n16:09:15 You: I\'ve made sure I\'ve upto date with priority bills\r\n16:09:19 Jodie (FRN 617534): What debt is the court letter for?\r\n16:09:35 You: Its a Lloyd\'s credit card\r\n16:09:56 You: That I had a while ago but couldnt afford to pay it and theyve just put extras on\r\n16:10:13 Jodie (FRN 617534): Okay so loans and credit cards are considered non-priority debts. <span>The consequences of not paying non-priority debts are less serious. If you don\'t pay non-priority debts, your creditor could eventually take you to court and instruct bailiffs to collect money from you. <a href=""https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/debt-collection.aspx"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/debt-collection.aspx</a></span>\r\n16:10:24 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Where debts are owed in joint names with other people, all parties are liable for the full balance and creditors can pursue you all until you have paid the sum in full. In some limited circumstances, a creditor will agree that you can pay your share of the full balance but it is important to remember that this isn\'t usually legally binding.</span>\r\n16:11:03 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Here is a link to a template hold letter to assist you.<br>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/sample-letters-to-creditors/Holding-letter/<br>You should ask the creditor to freeze interest and charges to stop the debt from increasing. Creditors don\'t have to do this but they do have to be reasonable.</span>\r\n16:11:31 You: So the only debts that are joint is the buddy loans and amigo loans\r\n16:11:37 You: All the rest are in my name\r\n16:11:44 Jodie (FRN 617534): Okay thankyou.\r\n16:12:04 Jodie (FRN 617534): So with a<span> debt relief order (DRO), it is one way to deal with your debts if you don’t own your own home, have less than £50 per month surplus income, and your debts are £20,000 or less. Here is some basic information about debt relief orders.<br><br>If you decide that this is an option you would like to take further, then you would need to speak to a debt adviser. You cannot apply for one yourself.<br>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/debt-solutions/debt-relief-orders/debt-relief-orders-explained/debt-relief-orders-what-you-need-to-know/</span>\r\n16:12:34 You: Yes I\'d like to apply for one\r\n16:13:27 Jodie (FRN 617534): As you mentioned that you estimate to have around £75 left over every month, you may not be eligible for a DRO but there may be other debt solutions available such as a DMP or IVA. \r\n16:13:41 Jodie (FRN 617534): It may be best to <span>contact our National Advice Line on 0800 144 8848 if you live in England, or 0800 702 2020 in Wales. Mon-Fri 9:00am – 5:00pm. They can refer you to a specialist debt adviser who will be able to assist you further with this issue.</span>\r\n16:14:55 You: Ok\r\n16:15:13 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Is there anything else I can help you with today?</span><br> \r\n16:15:30 You: No that\'s i4\r\n'

What brings you to our site today?</span>\r\n15:43:06 Daniel: Hi Sarah, I was recommending to talk to you in regards to managing my debt. Struggling with paying things off and wondered what options were out there to help\r\n15:44:48 Sarah (FRN 617699): Hi Daniel. I\'m sorry to hear that you are struggling. Do you know roughly how much debt you have and to how many creditors please?\r\n15:47:08 Daniel: £3500 on 2 credit cards, £10800 bank loan. My partner and I have a car we share but it\'s in my name , that is £19000 and we pay half each for the payments. I did a stupid think and took a £500 payday loan for 5 months at 1500apr\r\n15:48:03 Daniel: Because if recently took the car out in my name, my credit score dropped from excellent to poor, so I didn\'t have many options. I wasn\'t expecting such a harsh drop\r\n15:50:40 Daniel: I\'m quite far into my overdraft also\r\n15:50:48 Sarah (FRN 617699): what action have your creditors taken so far Daniel?\r\n15:51:45 Daniel: No actions have needed to be taken, I haven\'t missed any payments. I\'m just struggling to get out of my overdraft and pay off the debt. I\'m stuck paying minimum payments so feels like it will never go away\r\n15:52:01 Daniel: The payments I make leave me with not a lot of money left over each month\r\n15:54:54 Sarah (FRN 617699): ok Daniel, a<span>n overdraft is a non-priority debt. You could change your bank account and I have attached a link on changing banks.  If you pay income into an overdrawn current account, the bank will usually use it to reduce the overdraft before using it to pay off other debts. However, even if your account is overdrawn, you have the right to choose how a deposit made into it will be used. This is called the<b> first right of appropriation</b>. You should instruct the bank or building society that payments made into your account are to be used to pay for specific items. This is called <b>earmarking.</b> The bank has to act on your instructions and cannot refuse on the grounds that the account is overdrawn. However, you should remember that charges will still be accruing on the overdraft. A bank or building society is unlikely to allow you to use the first right of appropriation for long and may close your account.   </span>\r\n15:55:21 Sarah (FRN 617699): here is the link for you - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/banking/getting-a-bank-account/#h-changing-your-bank-or-building-society"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/banking/getting-a-bank-account/#h-changing-your-bank-or-building-society</a>     </span>\r\n15:56:09 Sarah (FRN 617699): if you have any debts linked to your bank account, you could open a safe account Daniel\r\n15:56:11 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>If you owe money to your bank or building society, it is important to make sure that any income, such as your wages or benefits, does not go into that account. This is because in some circumstances, banks and building societies can take money from an account you have with them to pay towards a debt that you owe them. This could leave you with too little money to pay your essential bills, such as your gas, electricity, and food shopping. A safe bank account is an account with a bank or building society that you do not owe any money to. This includes money owed to credit cards, loans, and overdrafts. If you open a current account and don\'t want to get into debt with the bank, request that you are not given an overdraft facility. This is because if you use your overdraft facility, the bank is likely to start charging interest on your account. An overdraft is also repayable on demand, so your money would no longer be safe. It is also important to know that some banks belong to the same banking group, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest. When you open a safe bank account you should try to avoid using a bank within the same banking group as a bank that you owe money to. If you do not, your money may still be at risk of being taken.

I have opened up a current account with Nationwide, currently with TSB. danielsaunby@icloud.com de655er\r\n16:00:35 Sarah (FRN 617699): thanks Daniel\r\n16:00:56 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Just in case we become disconnected or you need to contact us again regarding this or another issue I have assigned you a unique reference number, please keep this safe and quote it back to any of my colleagues you speak to in the future. Your reference is CL-104929516</span>\r\n16:01:47 Daniel: Ok thank you\r\n16:01:54 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span><b>You could request that your accounts are placed on hold</b>. Request that all charges and interest are suspended to allow you breathing space to deal with your debts. The creditors may require a budget sheet showing your household income and expenditure.            </span>\r\n16:02:29 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Template letters are also available on our website for you to contact creditors requesting holding action on your account and I have attached a link for you</span> - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/sample-letters-to-creditors/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/sample-letters-to-creditors/</a>    </span>\r\n16:03:06 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>If you are in difficulty, you could visit Turn2Us to complete a benefit entitlement check to ensure that you are claiming all benefits that you are entitled to and their link is attached</span> here for you - <span><a href=""https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou</a></span>\r\n16:03:22 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>There are also trusts and grants that may be able to assist you financially and here is the link for you:  <a href=""https://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/</a>  </span>\r\n16:05:07 Daniel: With my loan could I pause it to allow me to help with my debt? That\'d my biggest payment and would help a lot. My PCP car is £300 p/m and I pay £150 but I don\'t know if I can pause payments at all\r\n16:05:13 Daniel: Thank you I\'ll have a look.at them\r\n16:10:58 Sarah (FRN 617699): you could request a moratorium period Daniel\r\n16:11:28 Sarah (FRN 617699): this will place your accounts on hold to give you breathing space to deal with your debts\r\n16:11:38 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span><b><u>Moratorium Period</u></b> A moratorium is an <b>unspecified </b>period of relief from debt during which a debtor can seek the suspension of the payments and interest/charges relating to debt(s) owed to a Creditor and who cannot then take any action against the debtor for debt(s) owed to them. If a debtor is exploring or thinking about what debt option(s) is/are most appropriate and they require more time to think it over but are concerned about what their Creditors could do in the meantime, then they could request a moratorium period be granted. <u>Advantages </u> ·        No action being taken by Creditors can relieve any stress and anxiety caused. ·        Repayments, interest and charges can be frozen, so the level of debt is not exacerbated. ·        Can provide sufficient time for debtor(s) to seek and obtain pertinent debt advice in an unpressurised environment. ·        Help achieve a balanced and fairer outcome for both parties involved. ·        To allow an extended period to recovery from a temporary ‘blip’ or financial difficulty before any contractual repayments are recommenced. <u>Disadvantages </u> ·        It can often adversely affect the debtors Credit File and Credit Reference Record leading to a downgrading of the Credit Rating, thereby affect a Client’s ability to get future credit. ·        Some Creditors may refuse whilst others may agree to a moratorium and freeze interest / charges.</span>\r\n16:13:27 Sarah (FRN 617699): I know this is a lot of info to take in Daniel.

Creditors usually deal with vulnerable people more carefully.            You might be deemed vulnerable if, for example, you:            are disabled or seriously ill            are pregnant            are a single parent            are unemployed            have difficulty speaking or understanding English            ·        have mental health problems.        </span>\r\n16:20:18 Daniel: Thank you I\'ll look it over, my partner has gone on a debt relief order so I am trying to avoid anything like that as I would like to buy our house in the near future once debts are paid\r\n16:20:25 Daniel: I\'m not considered as vulnerable\r\n16:21:15 Sarah (FRN 617699): if you default Daniel on <span>your non-priority debts, if the debt remains unpaid, the creditor can pass the matter on to a debt collection agency to recover the debt owed or consider escalating the recovery through the Court by obtaining a County Court Judgment (CCJ) / High Court Judgment (HCJ) ordering payment of the debt.          </span>\r\n16:21:38 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Since Oct 1st, 2017 if a creditor (not an individual person) considers a debtor owes them money and they are contemplating starting Court action to recover it they must comply with the Pre-action Protocol; this involves sending the debtor a Letter of Claim, which will generally be accompanied by pre-set paperwork that the debtor will need to complete and return within a set timeframe (normally 30 days).          With a non-priority debt if escalated to Court action with a CCJ / HCJ Order made and the debt remained unpaid then enforcement of the Order could ensue. This would ultimately involve enforcement action such as engaging <b>County Court Bailiffs / High Court Enforcement Officers</b> aimed at taking personal things away; or obtaining an <b>Attachment of Earnings Order</b> aimed at any earned income; or a <b>Charging Order </b>aimed at securing the debt against any property owned; or a <b>Third Party Debt Order </b>aimed at any monies owed to a debtor, such as a bank A/C, requiring it to be paid to the creditor; although please note that some of these methods of enforcement may not be applicable to your circumstances.          </span>\r\n16:21:57 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Please note that creditors cannot enforce judgment in the <b>High Court </b>if the debt is covered by the <b>Consumer Credit Act</b> <b>1974. Credit cards and overdrafts are CCA regulated debts.</b>            CCJ/HCJ remains on a person’s credit file for 6 years and may prevent you from obtaining future credit.          In certain situations – if the debt owed is £5,000 or over – any creditor you owe money to, can apply to have you made bankrupt, even if you don’t want them to, by issuing you with a ‘Statutory Demand’ or by enforcing a Court Judgment that has been granted.               </span>\r\n16:22:37 Sarah (FRN 617699): here is a link with more info on actions that creditors can take to recover debts - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/creditor-takes-you-to-court-for-debt/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/creditor-takes-you-to-court-for-debt/</a> </span>\r\n16:23:11 Sarah (FRN 617699): and here is a link if the creditor passes the debt to bailiffs to recover - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/</a></span>\r\n16:25:00 Sarah (FRN 617699): here is a link on how to prioritise your debts Daniel - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-your-debts/work-out-which-debts-to-deal-with-first/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-your-debts/work-out-which-debts-to-deal-with-first/</a></span>\r\n16:26:47 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span><b>Joint Debts</b><br>The creditor could pursue you for payment of the full amount of any joint debts you have with your partner. This is because when you take out a joint credit agreement, you both agree to be responsible for the full amount of the debt. This is called <b>joint and several liability</b>.<br><br>If you signed the agreement jointly, then you will be joint and severally liable for the debt.  This means that you may remain 100% responsible for repaying the debt under the agreed terms. </span>\r\n16:27:33 Sarah (FRN 617699): as your partner has applied for a DRO, this will mean that any creditors will now chase you Daniel for any joint debts\r\n16:27:49 Sarah (FRN 617699): is there anything to want to ask me Daniel?\r\n'

 '15:39:52 info: Thanks - we’re connecting you to an adviser.\r\n15:39:58 info: You are now chatting with Sarah (FRN 617699).\r\n15:40:08 Sarah (FRN 617699): Hi Lucy. <span>Welcome to Citizens Advice. What brings you to our site today?</span>\r\n15:41:05 Lucy Ashworth: Hi yes I have received a letter through the post today from vehicle control services regarding parking notices\r\n15:41:55 Lucy Ashworth: To recover a sum of £2080 in respect of 13 parking charge notices\r\n15:42:45 Sarah (FRN 617699): Hi Lucy, does this relate to notices issued by your council or a private parking company?\r\n15:42:57 Lucy Ashworth: Private parking company\r\n15:44:01 Sarah (FRN 617699): have they been passed for enforcement action Lucy?\r\n15:44:57 Lucy Ashworth: Yes they are threatening my with taking me to ccj, these fines are from back in 2018 from when I was parking at my place of work\r\n15:45:12 Lucy Ashworth: I have not received any other letters in the post this is the first one\r\n15:45:47 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span><b>Parking Charge Notices are a non-priority debt. </b><b>    </b></span>\r\n15:45:58 Lucy Ashworth: What does this mean\r\n15:46:00 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>On one hand are priority debts, those that can threaten serious legal action if left unpaid, for example mortgages, rent, secured loans, council tax and utility bills. Court action is likely, and you could risk losing your collateral. </span><br><br> \r\n15:46:15 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Non-priority debts include credit card and store card arrears, catalogue debts, bank overdrafts, unsecured personal loans, and parking charge notices.  Whilst the initial ramifications are not as serious as priority debts, court action can still be taken.          </span>\r\n15:46:45 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>With non-priority debt, if the debt remains unpaid, the creditor can pass the matter on to a debt collection agency to recover the debt owed or consider escalating the recovery through the Court by obtaining a County Court Judgment (CCJ) / High Court Judgment (HCJ) ordering payment of the debt.       Since Oct 1st, 2017 if a creditor (not an individual person) considers a debtor owes them money and they are contemplating starting Court action to recover it they must comply with the Pre-action Protocol; this involves sending the debtor a Letter of Claim, which will generally be accompanied by pre-set paperwork that the debtor will need to complete and return within a set time-frame (normally 30 days).       With a non-priority debt if escalated to Court action with a CCJ / HCJ Order made and the debt remained unpaid then enforcement of the Order could ensue. This would ultimately involve enforcement action such as engaging <b>County Court Bailiffs / High Court Enforcement Officers</b> aimed at taking personal things away; or obtaining an <b>Attachment of Earnings Order</b> aimed at any earned income; or a <b>Charging Order </b>aimed at securing the debt against any property owned; or a <b>Third Party Debt Order </b>aimed at any monies owed to a debtor, such as a bank A/C, requiring it to be paid to the creditor; although please note that some of these methods of enforcement may not be applicable to your circumstances.                       Please note that creditors cannot enforce judgment in the <b>High Court </b>if the debt is covered by the <b>Consumer Credit Act</b> <b>1974. Parking charge notices are not CCA regulated debts.</b><br>CCJ/HCJ remains on a person’s credit file for 6 years and may prevent you from obtaining future credit.       In certain situations – if the debt owed is £5,000 or over – any creditor you owe money to, can apply to have you made bankrupt, even if you don’t want them to, by issuing you with a ‘Statutory Demand’ or by enforcing a Court Judgment that has been granted.          </span>\r\n15:47:13 Sarah (FRN 617699): here is a link with more info on non-priority debts for you Lucy - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-your-debts/work-out-which-debts-to-deal-with-first/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-your-debts/work-out-which-debts-to-deal-with-first/</a></span>\r\n15:47:36 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>You should check if the parking company is an Accredited Trade Association (ATA) member – either BPA or IPC.   </span>\r\n15:47:58 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>You can appeal to an independent appeals service. It’s free to do, so it’s worth trying if you still think your ticket was unfair. They might see things differently to the parking company and agree that your ticket should be cancelled. They won’t cancel a ticket because of an unexpected event, for example if you were delayed because you were feeling unwell.   </span>\r\n15:48:02 Lucy Ashworth: it is ipc\r\n15:48:24 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>The way to appeal will depend on if the parking company that gave you the ticket is a member of the BPA or IPC approved operators scheme. <a href=""http://popla.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>Make a formal appeal to Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA)</a> if they’re a BPA parking company. If they’re an IPC member, <a href=""https://www.theias.org/appeal"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>make a formal appeal to the Independent Appeals Service.</a>   Make sure you include any evidence that will support your case. If your formal appeal is rejected, you should pay your parking ticket. If you don’t, the cost could go up because you might have to go to court and pay court costs. The creditor has the right to take the issue of repayment of the debt through the county court. This may incur additional court fees and other charges, which would be added to the original debt.    </span><br><br><br> \r\n15:48:43 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Instructing bailiffs is the most common type of enforcement for parking penalty debts. Bailiffs must give you seven clear days\'<b> </b>notice that they are due to visit you. This is often known as the \'enforcement notice\'.    </span>\r\n15:48:57 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span><b>A bailiff can take control of goods outside your home, so if you have a vehicle, I advise you to keep it in a locked garage, if possible. If you park the vehicle on your drive or a public road, the bailiff could clamp and possibly remove it.</b>     </span>\r\n15:49:15 Lucy Ashworth: The letter states my time to appeal has expired even though this is the correspondence from the company\r\n15:49:37 Sarah (FRN 617699): here are links with more info on how to appeal Lucy - <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/appealing-a-parking-ticket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/appealing-a-parking-ticket/</a>      <a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/when-to-appeal-a-parking-ticket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/when-to-appeal-a-parking-ticket/</a><u> </u>   </span>\r\n15:49:41 Lucy Ashworth: this is the forst*\r\n15:50:07 Sarah (FRN 617699): please can I take your email address and postcode Lucy in case we become disconnected\r\n15:50:22 Lucy Ashworth: Lucyashworth98@outlook.com\r\n15:50:26 Lucy Ashworth: de127jg\r\n15:52:12 Lucy Ashworth: i have recently been offered a job with the police and had full vetting including debt and financial vetting and things like this is usually picked up in these sort of vetting but this was not I’m worried it is not real\r\n15:52:14 Sarah (FRN 617699): thanks Lucy\r\n15:52:30 Sarah (FRN 617699): <span>Just in case we become disconnected or you need to contact us again regarding this or another issue I have assigned you a unique reference number, please keep this safe and quote it back to any of my colleagues you speak to in the future.

Any refund needs to be given within 14 days and back to the manner paid. </span> OR\r\n15:49:47 Hannah: <span>You can seek a repair or a replacement from the trader, this should be done; free of charge, within a reasonable time and without causing a significant inconvenience to yourself, or they provide you with a like for like replacement. Under the legislation you must allow one attempt at a repair or replacement. The trader can do what is most cost effective.</span>\r\n15:51:18 Hannah: <span>What I would suggest at this time is to send them a written recorded delivery letter; recorded delivery, so they have to sign for the letter, this forms a paper trail and you have proof of receipt and delivery of the letter. Set a deadline by when you want a response and keep a copy for yourself. We do have template letters you can use on our website - www.citizensadvice.org.uk <br>Within the letter I would suggest to ask for their complaints procedure and also if they are a member or willing to use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) this is an arbitration or mediation that can be done between two parties.</span> \r\n15:51:55 Catrina sims: Ok thank you for your help. I will get the car into a local garage for inspection then speak to the dealer and see where we go from there.\r\n15:52:58 Hannah: No problem - you will need to give them the chance to do a repair / replacement first or do you short term right to reject\r\n15:53:12 Hannah: Would you like a reference number? \r\n15:53:30 Catrina sims: My daughter is currently driving the car but as soon as she is back to uni halls i will get her to park the car until we can get a solution. The issue is she is in hull and the garage is in mansfield.\r\n15:53:43 Catrina sims: Yes please.\r\n15:54:40 Catrina sims: Is there a way of getting a transcript of the converstion also? So i can speak with my husband about the options?\r\n15:55:09 Hannah: No problem - your reference number is 16632567 - <span>You can get a transcript of our conversation at the end of this chat. You'll need to click the plus sign (+) in the bottom left-hand corner of the chat window.</span>\r\n15:55:23 Catrina sims: Super thank you for your help.\r\n15:55:35 info: The chat transcript will be sent to: killerkatt@live.co.uk at the end of your chat.\r\n""

Negligence is a civil wrong and occurs when there is no direct contract between you and the trader / party. They owe you a duty of care, the duty has been breached causing a loss or damage to you. </span>\r\n15:46:58 Hannah: <span>The burden of proof is on yourself to prove they have breached the duty.You could look to potentially claim damages, this is any monetary loss, this does need to be justified and mitigated (at the lowest possible). </span><br> \r\n15:47:17 Hannah: <span>What I would suggest at this time is to send them a written recorded delivery letter; recorded delivery, so they have to sign for the letter, this forms a paper trail and you have proof of receipt and delivery of the letter. Set a deadline by when you want a response and keep a copy for yourself. We do have template letters you can use on our website - www.citizensadvice.org.uk <br><br>Within the letter I would suggest to ask for their complaints procedure and also if they are a member or willing to use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) this is an arbitration or mediation that can be done between two parties.</span> \r\n15:48:57 Dorothy White: They claim it was my fault as u shd have checked that the bottle top was secured.

February 2019 my benefits were stopped by DWP Reason was that they required bank statements dating back to 2011 in 21 days and banks did not supply me with these in the stipulated time.   Hence benefits were stopped as if I did not co-operate.  I did eventually provide statements and they are taking for ever to deal with this matter.   MPs have written to them several times and last was a week ago to expedite their re-consideration.   Now my income is very little from state pension and Council Tax has sent me their bill for payment which is out of my reach I require urgent assistance\r\n15:31:05 Lana: I understand, we can help with any debts you may have. It does sound like you also need specialist benefit advice which I can signpost you too after this  chat.

Priority debts are debts which, if not paid, can result in the loss of goods, services or your liberty.  Non priority debts are debts for which the consequences of non-payment are less severe and the creditors’ powers of recovery are more limited. Payments towards your priority debts therefore take priority over your non-priority debts </b></span>\r\n15:32:31 Lana: <br>Council Tax is a priority debt because the ultimate sanction for non payment is imprisonment, although this is very rare. How much is the debt? \r\n15:32:49 Ijaz Urrahman: 1366.35\r\n15:33:07 Lana: Thank you, do you have any other debts? \r\n15:33:13 Ijaz Urrahman: no\r\n15:33:46 Lana: Thank you. I do think it is also a good idea to speak to a benefits specialist about your benefits. i will get the number. We can then discuss the council tax debt. \r\n15:34:02 Ijaz Urrahman: I am grateful\r\n15:34:10 Lana: The number is <span>03444 111 444</span>. \r\n15:34:50 Lana: We will just need to take some background to see how this could be enforced. Are there any other adults living in the household? \r\n15:36:20 Ijaz Urrahman: Yes me dob 14/01/1945, wife dob 28/04/1955 she is on PIP and my son dob 24/01/1984 he is struggling too due to covid 19 and trying to get work\r\n15:37:15 Lana: I understand, there is a useful guide here on making the most of your money- <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgH8YauZ2G19hJIpaQyNz6vCwSyulw5WBWsurmeendw/edit"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgH8YauZ2G19hJIpaQyNz6vCwSyulw5WBWsurmeendw/</a> Have you checked to see if you can get a council tax reduction? \r\n15:37:50 Ijaz Urrahman: I did not know about it and I had not checked but will do upon completion of this chat\r\n15:37:53 Lana: You can check here- <br><span><b> <a href=""https://www.turn2us.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.turn2us.org.uk</a> or by speaking to Turn2us directly on 0808 802 2000.</b></span> But do contact your local office after this chat to discuss the benefit issue. If there are still general advisors on after this chat I can transfer you too. \r\n15:38:11 Lana: Okay, that is good. If you need help with any forms do contact us. \r\n15:38:21 Lana: <span><b>Are you a homeowner?</b></span>\r\n15:38:26 Ijaz Urrahman: no\r\n15:38:47 Lana: <span><b>Do you have any assets like a car, savings, pensions or property? </b></span> We ask because it can impact how they enforce and what options there could be for you. \r\n15:39:15 Ijaz Urrahman: car and 1 property\r\n15:39:32 Lana: Okay, so do you rent or have a mortgage? \r\n15:39:38 Ijaz Urrahman: and a private pension paying £79 per month\r\n15:39:45 Ijaz Urrahman: I rent this house\r\n15:39:53 Ijaz Urrahman: do not have mortgae\r\n15:39:55 Ijaz Urrahman: te\r\n15:40:01 Ijaz Urrahman: do not have mortgage\r\n15:40:10 Lana: Okay, but do you own one you do not live in? \r\n15:40:27 Ijaz Urrahman: Yes it is rented producing £350 per month rent\r\n15:40:40 Lana: Thank you. \r\n15:40:52 Lana: I will just explain how council tax can be enforced. \r\n15:41:01 Ijaz Urrahman: OK\r\n15:41:03 Lana: <br>If you fail to pay Council Tax, the Council Tax Unit will issue a liability summons. Costs are added to the debt and a liability hearing will follow. Once the Council has obtained the Liability Order it can take different enforcement action against you to recover the money. \r\n15:41:34 Ijaz Urrahman: This letter says they have added the court costs\r\n15:42:14 Lana: Once they have a liability order they can enforce a number of different ways. For example, bailiffs, deduction from wages/benefits, charging order on your property and making you Bankrupt. Have you explained the situation with your benefits and asked for a payment plan? \r\n15:42:19 Ijaz Urrahman: Heading says Special Arrangments\r\n15:43:35 Ijaz Urrahman: DWP is constantly in touch with me as two years ago they had imposed deduction of £30 per week on me which they are taking from my state pension already\r\n15:43:55 Lana: Okay, so is there a benefit overpayment as well? \r\n15:46:11 Ijaz Urrahman: Yes they had said I have been overpaid which emerged due to the fact that they have lost the documents for previous years,  I had notified them that I am purchasing this property back in 2011 and have been declaring rental income yearly in tax returns,  This they have to take into consideration upon re-consideration which is what is being held up for lhe last 2 years\r\n15:46:36 Lana: I understand, how much is the overpayment? \r\n15:46:50 Ijaz Urrahman: 64K +\r\n15:46:58 Lana: <br>If you can’t afford the deductions from your benefits/wage, then you can ask the DWP Debt Management Team (0800 916 0647) to reduce the deductions and highlight the hardship the deductions are causing, by producing a financial statement to show what you need for your basic essential expenses.\r\n15:47:22 Lana: This would be classed as non priority. If they are not able to take deductions they could enforce through the County Court. \r\n15:47:34 Ijaz Urrahman: is there a form to fill\r\n15:47:40 Lana: It sounds as if it will be best to have a full appointment to look into all your options. \r\n15:47:48 Ijaz Urrahman: OK\r\n15:47:51 Lana: No, you would need to call them up, \r\n15:48:00 Lana: <span><b>I\'d advise to draw up your budget: <a href=""https://tools.nationaldebtline.org/yourbudget/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://tools.nationaldebtline.org/yourbudget/</a>. If you don’t take into account the debts for a moment, you can use the budget to help you manage your living expenses (including food and necessities), and your ongoing bills, to try and help you manage on your income. If there is then any money left over that’s spare, that’ll be your disposable income. You can use that to help you work out what options are going to be available to you. Your local Citizens Advice can help with this if you’d like.

Your answers will help us find the right solution for you. Is this ok?</span>\r\n15:23:05 You: Yes\r\n15:23:18 Christina (FRN 617546): <span>Firstly I need to check if you have any of what we call priority debts. These would be arrears with a mortgage or secured loan, Rent, Council Tax, Magistrate’s Court Fines, TV Licence, Energy, Child Maintenance payments, Income Tax, National Insurance, VAT, Hire Purchase (for an essential item). Do you have arrears with any of these? Or are they up to date?</span>\r\n15:24:01 You: I have County court claim letter\r\n15:24:21 Christina (FRN 617546): What is the debt relating to the claim? \r\n15:25:13 You: From catalogue\r\n15:25:29 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay and do you agree you owe the debt? \r\n15:25:55 You: Yes\r\n15:26:10 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay and when did you receive the claim form? \r\n15:26:22 You: Last month\r\n15:26:56 You: But I\'ve already sent the letter to then stated that I get less income but they wanted me to pay every month which I don\'t have money to pay\r\n15:27:26 Christina (FRN 617546): I see, so you have responded to the claim form. \r\n15:27:32 Christina (FRN 617546): Is this your only debt?\r\n15:27:32 You: Yes\r\n15:27:46 You: Yes\r\n15:27:55 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay and how much is the outstanding debt? \r\n15:28:40 You: Around 20000\r\n15:29:10 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay and do you have any assets like a car, savings, property, etc? \r\n15:29:22 You: No nothing\r\n15:29:38 Christina (FRN 617546): <span>After you have paid for all your essential expenditure items (eg rent, council tax, fuel, water, groceries etc - but not payments to credit debts) how much money do you feel you have left?</span>\r\n15:30:02 You: None because the less income the more going out\r\n15:31:36 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay. I recommend you look at a Debt Relief Order (DRO) this is a formal insolvcey option. It costs £90 and if successful after 12 months your debts are written off. There are some restrictions in place with a DRO. You can see more on this here:<span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/debt-solutions/debt-relief-orders/debt-relief-orders-explained/debt-relief-orders-what-you-need-to-know/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/debt-solutions/debt-relief-orders/debt-relief-orders-explained/debt-relief-orders-what-you-need-to-know/</a></span>\r\n15:31:58 You: Ok I\'ll have a look\r\n15:32:28 Christina (FRN 617546): no worries, you ned to find out the exact amount you owe as the current DRO limit is £20,000\r\n15:32:39 You: Ok\r\n15:32:50 Christina (FRN 617546): If you find it is more than £20,000 you can either pay off some of your debt and then apply\r\n15:32:59 You: Ok\r\n15:33:33 Christina (FRN 617546): Or the DRO eligibility criteria is changing and the limit may be increased to £30,000. \r\n15:33:42 You: Ok\r\n15:34:09 Christina (FRN 617546): I also recommend that you look at maximising your income.  \r\n15:34:17 Christina (FRN 617546): <span>One thing we advise to everyone is to make sure that you have checked that you are receiving everything you are entitled to.

What brings you to our site today?</span>\r\n15:22:13 Edward Mole: Was hoping for some advice regarding claiming money back from a fraudulent tradesman. I\'ve already sent 2 letters quoting consumer rights act and ADR without response. I spoke on the phone to a citizens advice rep yesterday and they gave me a number to discuss court matters, but it was just the main citizens advice helpline again which wasn\'t any help.\r\n15:22:40 Edward Mole: Do you have a specific number for court related matters or can you comment on it now?\r\n15:24:39 Emma-Jayne: Ok we can look to help you. What is it youre looking to find out regarding this? we have a consumer team that may be able to help but it depends what stage youre at \r\n15:26:50 Edward Mole: I want to know exactly how far the courts can go to recover what was stolen before I decide whether or not to go through with it. I\'ve been warned that if the defendant doesn\'t have it anymore I won\'t get anything back. I\'m not expecting him to cooperate at any stage so I think my only real hope will be to get bailiffs involved\r\n15:28:39 Edward Mole: And what if his circumstances change? For example the judge rules in my favour but he has nothing, but 6 months later he gets employed and there\'s an opportunity to claim. Can cases be re-opened?\r\n15:29:33 Edward Mole: Or if bailiffs seize his car which is insufficient to cover the cost of what he stole, could another car be seized if he gets a new one?\r\n15:29:49 Emma-Jayne: Ok thank you. Have you spoken to any other organisations about this other than us?\r\n15:30:19 Edward Mole: Mainly citizens advice. Trading standards too but they weren\'t much help.\r\n15:30:36 Edward Mole: Have also read advice on the Money Claim Online website.\r\n15:31:18 Edward Mole: Not looking for legal advice specifically relating to my case, just information on how far courts can go to recover money from uncooperative individuals.\r\n15:32:21 Emma-Jayne: No problem. As you h<span>ave used Citizens Advice before If you have a reference number I can look up the details of your previous contact.</span>\r\n15:32:37 Edward Mole: 1637 4694\r\n15:33:22 Emma-Jayne: Thank you.

I\'ve saved the links\r\n15:38:04 Edward Mole: Couple more questions\r\n15:39:20 Edward Mole: I\'m also attempting to have criminal charges against him under the Fraud act. Contacted Action Fraud 3 months ago and not had any response. Do you know if this line of approach could be sped up if there is evidence that he is hitting dozens of people?\r\n15:40:10 Emma-Jayne: You would need to speak to action fraud regarding that to see if it can be \r\n15:41:07 Edward Mole: Thanks\r\n15:42:33 Edward Mole: Last question. Court fees. I understand that there\'s an initial cost of claiming money and a bailiff\'s fee if the defendant doesn\'t cooperate. Are there possibly any more charges?\r\n15:43:05 Edward Mole: Don\'t want to get sucked into a nightmare scenario where I\'m forced to pay more and more or abandon the case.\r\n15:43:07 Emma-Jayne: It would depend if the defendant tried to add charges for you to pay but the judge would decide if you had to pay them\r\n15:43:35 Edward Mole: Okay thanks. That\'ll do for today then. I might get in touch with a solicitor.\r\n15:43:44 Edward Mole: Thanks for your time Emma-Jayne\r\n15:43:58 Emma-Jayne: Youre welcome. <span>Please come back if you do need anything else, thank you for using citizens advice, best of luck with it all, take care and bye for now</span>\r\n15:44:02 info: Thank you for chatting with us.\r\n'

How much do you receive per week?\r\n15:22:37 Shana Morris: On average when I was on furlough I was earning £160 per week\r\n15:22:59 Shana Morris: They kept insisting it was because I was an 8 hour contract but I know that’s not right\r\n15:24:26 Doug: I\'ll check out the rules for statutory sick pay to see if there\'s any justification in what your employer is saying.

It is not based on your contracted hours of work. You should have followed your employer\'s procedures which would normally include you sending your employer a fit note from your GP to cover your period off sick. \r\n15:32:53 Doug: Are you aware of anything you failed to do, e.g. not sending your employer a fit note?\r\n15:34:22 Shana Morris: No I sent everything, I notified them correctly and had to get a family member to drop in my sick line\r\n15:36:32 Doug: It would appear that your employer has not paid you money which is due to you. Your next step would be to raise a grievance with your employer. I can send you a link to our website where we have information about sick pay and also about dealing with problems at work.

I paid 1277,36 pounds for two return tickets. They cancelled one way. I paid by debit card and I made the purchase on their website.\r\n15:25:21 Hannah: Did the airline cancel the flights?\r\n15:25:27 Luiz Carlos Froes: Yes\r\n15:25:32 Hannah: Okay - \r\n15:25:41 Hannah: <span>You can argue that the trader is in breach of contract under common law. The burden of proof is on yourself to prove they are in breach of contract. </span><br> \r\n15:25:42 Luiz Carlos Froes: They cancel the return\r\n15:25:46 Hannah: <span>As the contract has not been affirmed; you have reported the breach within a reasonable time and not accepted the breach by continuing with the service, you can seek to repudiate the contract; this would be to end the contract and get a full refund and be put in your pre contractual position, or you can ‘make time of the essence’ (set a deadline for the completion and if this fails then will claim a full refund) for the trader to fulfil the contract. </span><br> \r\n15:25:53 Hannah: <span>What I would suggest at this time is to send them a written recorded delivery letter; recorded delivery, so they have to sign for the letter, this forms a paper trail and you have proof of receipt and delivery of the letter. Set a deadline by when you want a response and keep a copy for yourself. We do have template letters you can use on our website - www.citizensadvice.org.uk <br><br>Within the letter I would suggest to ask for their complaints procedure and also if they are a member or willing to use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) this is an arbitration or mediation that can be done between two parties. </span>\r\n15:26:04 Hannah: Your reference number is 16632506 - <span>You can get a transcript of our conversation at the end of this chat. You'll need to click the plus sign (+) in the bottom left-hand corner of the chat window.</span>\r\n15:29:27 Luiz Carlos Froes: A letter is better than an email? Because I already sent them an email and also made a complaint in their website. I have all the protocol numbers\r\n15:29:51 Hannah: Yes we always suggest as letter\r\n15:30:56 Luiz Carlos Froes: And what happens after. If they don't pay\r\n15:31:08 Hannah: Contact us back and we can advise from there\r\n15:31:19 Luiz Carlos Froes: Okay\r\n15:31:23 Luiz Carlos Froes: Thanks\r\n15:31:29 Hannah: <span>Thank you for contacting us today, take care.

We would only ever pass on your details in this way to a third party for the sole purpose of gathering feedback. Do you consent to us sharing your information in this way?</span>\r\n15:08:55 Lea: Regarding your enquiry today, how can we help?\r\n15:11:37 Katie Bigglestone: I have got to the section where I confirm what I have written and the section where it say who lives with you has recorded I have no children which is correct but it then says other people living with you as none but I live with my parents but there’s no option to put that\r\n15:12:36 Lea: Ok, at the start when you was asked if you have housing costs did you choose yes or no?\r\n15:13:02 Katie Bigglestone: I chose no\r\n15:14:22 Lea: Ok thank you, if you are unable to include that you live with your parents, once you have answered all of your to-do list you will see that a journal tab wil appear you will be able to write a message to Universal Credit through this journal explaining that you hadn\'t been able to include this information &gt; Journal &gt; Add a journal entry &gt; leave a message for your work coach \r\n15:14:38 Lea: <span>You are able to request for the transcript of this chat to be sent you via email.

I currently have a balance issue and walking problems of which I’m under a neurological consultant but have no diagnosis yet as waiting for a brain scan. Although I am able to work I have to factor these conditions I to what job I could do as I find some stairs difficult to manage. It seems to steal you towards wanting doctors notes and that you can’t work rather that would find some work challenging\r\n15:21:47 Lea: You would be able to choose that you have a health condition / disability that affects your ability to work, if you choose that you don\'t have a sick note it shall give you the option to include a date of which your condition has affected you from, you would then be able to provide further evidence at a later date. If you don\'t have an exact diagnosis you can inform them how your health affects you such as issues with mobility and balance etc \r\n15:22:27 Lea: It would be best to include as much information and that it has affected you from said date, so that they know you have limited capability / find some work challenging and wouldn\'t be able to do all types of work \r\n15:22:52 Lea: <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/getting-universal-credit-if-youre-sick-or-disabled/#:~:text=You%20can%20claim%20Universal%20Credit,called%20the%20\'transitional%20element\'."" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/getting-universal-credit-if-youre-sick-or-disabled/#:~:text=You%20can%20claim%20Universal%20Credit,called%20the%20\'transitional%20element\'.</a></span>\r\n15:25:15 Katie Bigglestone: Ok. It’s asked for a start date of this condition and it has progressed over the last couple of years but I have no real start date and have had a retail job up until last November when I was made redundant. As it was a small shop the girls I worked with knew my limitations. Do I just pluck a random date to put in that box\r\n15:26:37 Lea: You would be able to choose a date as close to when your condition has affected you from, which ever year you started dealing with your condition, if you feel it was at the start of said month choose 1st and if its towards the end can include the end of the months date. \r\n15:27:36 Katie Bigglestone: ok thank you. This has been very helpful.\r\n15:28:06 Lea: You\'re most welcome!

I would like to apply for universal credit and she does not. Would I be able to apply without her or is it mandatory to apply together ?\r\n15:04:00 Jorja-May: Hi, you will need to make a joint claim for universal credit as you have a partner who lives with you. Therefore their situation including their savings and income will be taken into account. \r\n15:06:32 Mona: Are there any other options because she really does not want to apply and i need to ?\r\n15:07:34 Jorja-May: Depending on your previous employment history, you may be entitled to New Style Jobseekers Allowance.

 '15:01:30 info: Thanks - we’re connecting you to an adviser.\r\n15:01:35 info: You are now chatting with Leanne (FRN617546).\r\n15:01:47 Leanne (FRN617546): Hi Natalie, <span>l understand you have contacted us about a debt issue today, how can I help?</span>\r\n15:04:38 Natalie: Hi. Yes I’m dealing with the debts myself instead of using a company and all is going well. I have received settlement offer from a couple of companies. My accounts were defaulted more than 6yrs a go and when speaking to a company they said although they Mark it as partially settled companies can’t see it when looking as it was more than 6yrs a go\r\n15:05:08 Leanne (FRN617546): <span>Thank you for sharing your issue with us. The advice that you receive today is free but our costs are partly funded by the Money and Pensions Service and we will share some of your data with the Money and Pensions Service. If you would like further information or would like to object about how the Money and Pensions Service use your data, please visit: <a href=""http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/corporate/about-our-debt-work"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/corporate/about-our-debt-work</a></span>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\r\n15:05:10 Natalie: is this information they gave correct?\r\n15:05:35 Leanne (FRN617546): <span>Can I just quickly check, have you used Citizens Advice before? If you have a reference number I can look up the details of your previous contact.</span>\r\n15:05:54 Natalie: no I haven’t\r\n15:06:35 Leanne (FRN617546): <span>Just in case we become disconnected or you need to contact us again regarding this or another issue I have assigned you a unique reference number, please keep this safe and quote it back to any of my colleagues you speak to you in the future. Your reference is:</span> CL-104926099\r\n15:06:54 Natalie: ok cheers\r\n15:08:04 Leanne (FRN617546): If the default has already fallen off your credit report after the 6 years period <span>it will NOT reappear after a partial settlement</span>. If the default is no longer on there then it won\'t be having an impact on your credit rating now. \r\n15:08:35 Leanne (FRN617546): The key thing is though that it won\'t reappear and it won\'t cause any further detriment to your credit report if the default has already gone\r\n15:09:25 Leanne (FRN617546): Does that answer your query?\r\n15:09:44 Natalie: Thank you so much. How do I check to see if accounts have defaulted and when? I have 3 companies offering payment settlements and can clear them and pay off bigger debts quicker\r\n15:10:10 Leanne (FRN617546): The default date should show on your credit file\r\n15:10:32 Leanne (FRN617546): It is only the date of the first default that matters and they will remain for 6 years\r\n15:11:08 Leanne (FRN617546): Even if a default is still on there, making a settlement won\'t change the date that the default drops off\r\n15:11:25 Leanne (FRN617546): So, it won\'t stay on there for any longer for example\r\n15:14:17 Natalie: i just want to get my debts paid off quicker. So if the default is on there and it was 7yrs a go a partial settlement won’t affect my credit rating as I also want to improve my score\r\n15:14:39 Leanne (FRN617546): No it won\'t have any impact\r\n15:15:09 Leanne (FRN617546): You can read more about partial settlements here: <span><a href=""https://debtcamel.co.uk/debt-options/less-common/full-final/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://debtcamel.co.uk/debt-options/less-common/full-final/</a></span>\r\n15:15:39 Leanne (FRN617546): It also covers your credit rating and what we\'ve discussed already regarding defaults that have dropped off and those that remain\r\n15:15:44 Natalie: how can I improve my credit score?\r\n15:17:05 Leanne (FRN617546): There is some really good information detailing everything you can do to improve your score here: <span><a href=""https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating</a></span>\r\n15:17:13 Natalie: my old debt management company told me that if I partially settled an account other companies can see it and be very difficult when it comes to negotiating a monthly payment\r\n15:17:50 Natalie: even though my debts have defaulted over 6yrs a go\r\n15:18:24 Leanne (FRN617546): <span>If the debt is no longer listed on your credit report though, no one can see it regardless of how you deal with it.</span>\r\n15:20:03 Natalie: thank you. I’ll get calling the companies cus a family member has given me some money as a gift in that case I can pay them off and increase payments on my bigger debts\r\n15:20:17 Leanne (FRN617546): If you didn\'t already have a default for the debt, yes at this point settling a debt as partially satisfied would remain on your credit file for 6 years but when they have already defaulted it doesn\'t have any impact.\r\n15:20:31 Leanne (FRN617546): Is there anything else I can help with Natalie?\r\n15:21:48 Natalie: no that’s it thank you. It’s just the understanding and checking of the debt and default on my credit report. Is there a free way of checking my credit report as Experian charge £15\r\n15:22:39 Leanne (FRN617546): If you request a <span>\'statutory report\'</span> it is free from all three credit reference agencies\r\n15:22:48 Leanne (FRN617546): <span><a href=""https://experian.co.uk/consumer/statutory-report.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>Experian</a>, <a href=""https://www.equifax.co.uk/Products/credit/statutory-report.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>Equifax</a> and <a href=""https://www.callcreditstatreport.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>TransUnion (formerly Callcredit)</a></span>\r\n15:23:45 Natalie: how do I request a statutory report, is it something I have to phone them to request?\r\n15:24:14 Leanne (FRN617546): You should be able to request it online\r\n15:24:33 Natalie: ok thank uou\r\n15:24:39 Leanne (FRN617546): They try and direct you to the paid versions so you might need to dig around on the websites\r\n15:24:41 Natalie: *you\r\n15:25:13 Leanne (FRN617546): You\'re welcome Natalie. Thanks for your time today. Take care and good luck with the settlement offers.\r\n15:25:35 Natalie: thank you for your help today\r\n15:26:08 Leanne (FRN617546): <span>I hope you have found the service useful today. We would really appreciate it if you could complete the 3 quick automated satisfaction questions at the end of this chat.</span>\r\n15:26:11 info: Thank you for chatting with us.\r\n'
 '15:00:59 info: Thanks - we’re connecting you to an adviser.\r\n15:01:07 info: You are now chatting with Katy.\r\n15:01:17 Rebecca Cook: Hi Katy\r\n15:01:24 Katy: <span>Welcome to Citizens Advice - how can I help you?</span>\r\n15:04:48 Rebecca Cook: My Husband and I jointly own a property and due to a social services safety plan I have had to leave the property with my Son and currently living at my Moms house. My Husband has asked me for a separation and his intentions are to remortgage the property and buy me out. He has given me a screenshot of a Child Maintenance calculation he has done and has asked me to sort out my universal credit claim. My question is, if he does buy me out and I get a lump sum, if I were to use that money to purchase a property (with a small mortgage possibly) would I still be entitled to universal credit to top up my income as I currently work 8 hours a week and the only benefits I receive is Child benefit at £84.40 a month\r\n15:06:21 Katy: I will have a look at this for you, can I just check whether you have contacted Citizens Advice before?\r\n15:06:53 Rebecca Cook: I have not personally but my Husband said he has been in contact with yourselves. His name is Simon Cook\r\n15:09:39 Katy: Thank you, just bear with me and I\'ll be back with the information about how the capital will be treated\r\n15:09:47 Rebecca Cook: Ok thank you\r\n15:11:57 Katy: OK, so in the Universal Credit Regulations (Schedule 10, paragraph 13) it states that:\r\n15:13:30 Katy: ""where a person has received an amount within the past 6 months which is to be used to purchase premises that the person intend to occupy as their home, the amount can be disregarded"" where it ""is attributable to the proceeds of the sale of premises formerly occupied as their home"" \r\n15:14:21 Katy: This would apply in your situation, in the meantime, the value of the property that your husband is living in will be disregarded as it is a property you have vacated in the past 6 months \r\n15:14:40 Katy: and that is covered in Schedule 10, paragraph 5 of the Universal Credit regulations\r\n15:18:21 Rebecca Cook: Ok so just to clarify, I could make a claim now but I would need to use the money that I receive from the house within 6m to purchase another property so it would not affect my existing claim? Sorry to ask but this is all new to me and I just want to make sure that I get the correct information and do not get into any trouble with HMRC\r\n15:19:01 Katy: That\'s not a problem\r\n15:19:21 Katy: Yes you can claim now and you need to make an effort to purchase the property within six months \r\n15:19:42 Katy: but if it is found \'reasonable\' for it to take longer than six months\r\n15:19:58 Katy: for example if you found somewhere and then the seller changed their mind or changed the price \r\n15:20:07 Katy: or you could not find somewhere that was suitable for your family \r\n15:20:18 Katy: there is flexibility for the capital to be disregarded for longer \r\n15:20:44 Katy: you may need to justify this if you were asked\r\n15:21:42 Katy: it is also likely that you would need to explain the situation when you receive the capital for your share of the house, in order to make sure the capital is correctly disregarded\r\n15:22:08 Katy: after you make a claim for Universal Credit, you gain access to an area of the online account called the Journal \r\n15:22:21 Katy: and the Journal is your main way to communicate with Universal Credit\r\n15:22:41 Katy: It is where you would report any changes e.g. change of address, change of working hours\r\n15:23:04 Katy: and it is also where you can make a note of things like why the capital should be disregarded\r\n15:26:27 Rebecca Cook: That\'s brilliant thank you so much for all of that information. I do have another question: my Husband has done a child maintenance calculation and I am a little bit confused as to how he has got to this figure. I was wondering how I would be able to check that he has entered the correct information before agreeing to this amount? Or would it be a case of asking my Solicitor to request full financial disclosure from himself?\r\n15:29:23 Katy: The Money Advice Service recommends that when people are making an arrangement between themselves, that they use the government\'s child maintenance calculator to check against the amount\r\n15:29:33 Katy: <span><a href=""https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-child-maintenance-should-i-pay"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-much-child-maintenance-should-i-pay</a></span>\r\n15:29:39 Katy: <span><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/calculate-child-maintenance"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.gov.uk/calculate-child-maintenance</a></span>\r\n15:30:17 Katy: there are some percentages given as guidance, but if you are not 100% on his income figures etc, then it would likely be an issue to discuss with your solicitor\r\n15:31:50 Rebecca Cook: Ok thank you so much. I will raise this issue with my Solicitor at my next appointment\r\n15:32:08 Katy: You\'re very welcome\r\n15:32:17 Katy: Is there anything else I can help you with?\r\n15:32:49 Rebecca Cook: No not at the moment thank you. I\'ve got all of the information that I need at this time. Thank you for your help I really appreciate it\r\n15:33:08 Katy: No worries, good luck with everything Rebecca\r\n15:33:30 Katy: If you have any questions during the claims process please do not hesitate to get in touch again \r\n15:33:53 Katy: Your reference number for this chat is CL-104928002\r\n15:34:34 Rebecca Cook: Thank you and I\'ll make a log of the reference number incase I need it in the future\r\n15:34:57 Katy: Thank you for contacting Citizens Advice\r\n'

May O have a contact telephone number please?\r\n14:27:01 Kate: 07598 701858\r\n14:27:58 Patrick: Thank you. If we try to get ion touch but can\'t get through are we alright to leave voicemails and SMS messages? \r\n14:28:23 Kate: Sms not voicemails\r\n14:28:47 Patrick: No problem.

Here\'s your client number: <span>CL-104925566</span><br>If you need to get back in touch with us for any reason please quote that number and the next adviser will be able to find you on our system. \r\n14:29:59 Patrick: How can I help today?\r\n14:30:40 Kate: so I wanted to apply for universal credit but I have no bank account and don’t have id to open one\r\n14:31:16 Patrick: I see. Have you already started the application process for UC?\r\n14:31:45 Kate: i started to fill out form online until realised bout bank account\r\n14:34:09 Patrick: OK. You can request the money be paid into a friend or family member\'s account until you get yours sorted. You can also request a PES payment whereby you get the money in cash from a pay point but it\'s rare they agree to do that these days. The bigger problem you\'ll encounter is if you don\'t have any ID to open a bank account presumably you don\'t have any ID to confirm your identity with UC? Do you know your National Insurance number?\r\n14:35:16 Kate: No I contacted job centre via email bout it they said as I signed on before years ago they have my national insurance number already\r\n14:35:34 Kate: I don’t have friends or family account I can use\r\n14:36:25 Patrick: Give me two minutes and I\'ll get the online form up and see what other options appear on there\r\n14:36:33 Kate: ok\r\n14:38:34 Patrick: I\'ve found it. Do you have the form in front of you?\r\n14:39:04 Kate: no as I’m using net on my phone and that were I filled form in\r\n14:43:45 Patrick: In which case it might be best to write this down. I\'ve found a suggestion here that says if you enter a dummy account that should work. Write \'no account\' in the bank name box, \'no account\' in the name on account box, six zeros in the sort code box and eight zeros in the account number box. You have to do that three times as it won\'t accept it the first two. Then once your account has been created and your claim submitted you can go into your Journal and write a message to your Work Coach explaining the situation and requesting a PES payment. Here\'s some information about PES payments: <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/advisernet/benefits/benefits-administration/overpayments-calculations-and-getting-paid/payment-of-benefits-state-pension-and-tax-credit-into-accounts/#hm_government_payment_service"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/advisernet/benefits/benefits-administration/overpayments-calculations-and-getting-paid/payment-of-benefits-state-pension-and-tax-credit-into-accounts/#hm_government_payment_service</a></span> \r\n14:44:23 Kate: Ok ty\r\n14:45:03 Patrick: With regards to verifying your ID with the DWP, have you got any documents that have your name and address on?\r\n14:45:36 Kate: I only have my birth certificate\r\n14:46:49 Patrick: I\'m just asking a few colleagues if they think that\'ll be enough. Can you stay online for a few minutes whilst I wait for a response?\r\n14:46:57 Kate: sure\r\n14:48:00 Patrick: Do you have any housing costs?\r\n14:49:07 Kate: No\r\n14:51:02 Patrick: No worries. My colleagues think your birth certificate and National Insurance number should be enough. What they will probably do is arrange a biographical ID appointment where they will ask you questions that only you will know the answer to such as previous addresses and previous jobs or benefit claims etc. That may be over the phone or may be at the Job Centre.\r\n14:51:34 Kate: ok\r\n14:52:12 Patrick: If you need any more help making your UC claim please do come back to us either via Webchat or by telephoning us on 0800 144 8444 and quoting the client number I gave you earlier. \r\n14:52:38 Patrick: Would you like me to transfer you to a Generalist Adviser who might be able to help you set up a bank account?\r\n14:52:47 Kate: sure\r\n14:53:20 Patrick: No problem. You may be waiting a little while but please stay online.

 ""14:57:52 info: Thanks - we’re connecting you to an adviser.\r\n14:57:58 info: You are now chatting with Sherryl.\r\n14:58:00 Kamal: Hello, I am kamal. In on universal  credit 2 months ago I get letter from local council says I'm in clinically extremely vulnerable so, you have to claim employment and support allowance.  So then i claimed.then, In 22nd March I received letter from Department for public health saying you're not eligible for esa from 1st april. So, I'm not eligible for it. But, I get health assessment it was due 23rd april, didn't complete it because I'm not eligible. Is my esa will stop immediately?\r\nAnd is it affect universal credit?\r\n14:58:40 Sherryl: Hi kamal, I am Sherryl.  Just reading your enquiry.\r\n15:01:21 Sherryl: for clarification kamal - You applied for Universal Credit 2 months ago, and was advised by your local authority that you had to apply for ESA.  ESa are not stating you are not eligible for the benefit?\r\n15:01:42 Kamal: No I claim uc in 20-3 21\r\n15:01:56 Kamal: Get letter in feb\r\n15:02:29 Sherryl: You are in receipt of UC correct.

I need ESA to stop because in 22 march Department of public health says I'm no longer eligible this means esa should stop\r\n15:06:30 Sherryl: Have you contacted ESA? \r\n15:06:45 Kamal: No\r\n15:07:27 Kamal: Does jobcentre or ESA service know I'm not eligible\r\n15:08:10 Sherryl: So, you are not receiving any payment from ESA?\r\n15:09:04 Kamal: No I'm not receiving any payments and I dont want to, why I'm getting assessment and letter from there?\r\n15:09:53 Sherryl: If you are in receipt of Unviersal Credit, which is a means-tested benefit you cannot apply for ESA income related which is also a means tested benefit, as UC has replaced ESA income related.\r\n15:10:29 Sherryl: If you have received a letter from ESA then you need to contact them. Advising that you are in receipt of UC.  \r\n15:10:39 Kamal: That health assessment was due 23 april. I get letter today says they need it urgently\r\n15:11:06 Kamal: Okay, if I say I'm in UC. Does they cancel that claim automatically\r\n15:11:33 Kamal: That would be great because that what I want to cancel\r\n15:11:50 Sherryl: You need to contact them stating you are in receipt of Universal Credit. ESA will them contact UC.\r\n15:12:13 Sherryl: ?Have you had an assessment with UC\r\n15:12:21 Kamal: No\r\n15:12:42 Sherryl: How much do you receive from UC?\r\n15:13:17 Kamal: £1220\r\n15:14:28 Sherryl: What does the £1220 comprise of i.e. standard allowance is £411.51; do you have housing cost?\r\n15:14:48 Kamal: So I dont need to do assessment\r\n15:15:05 Kamal: Work capability Questionnaire\r\n15:16:44 Sherryl: If you are unable to work due to a disability or mental health issues, and you provide Universal Credit with a GP sick note, this will normally trigger an assessment,  if you have limited capability for work and work related activity you will receive an extra £343 per month on top of you entitlment to UC.  \r\n""

And what deadline did you give them to respond?\r\n15:11:22 kirstie: Yes I do, he responded the same day to the email copy of the letter.  He said it was all ridiculous and would not be paying the sum requested.  A few days later he emailed asking as we had 3 separate quotes can he send a couple of roofing contractors to inspect the roof, perhaps he could get three quotes as well was his suggestion\r\n15:14:07 Sam: <br><span>Ok. what did you request in the letter?</span>\r\n15:17:51 Sam: <br><span>Hello, are you still there, how are you getting on? </span>\r\n15:18:11 kirstie: we requested the amount of the lowest of the three quotes we had to replace the roof and have it completed.

As we already have independent quotes, does he have any rights to send someone to look at it.  My mother in law is anxious and doesn\'t want him in her house.  He has already and two attempts to repair but it is still not right.  The roof isn\'t even attached to the main beams?\r\n15:25:45 Sam: The burden of proof is on yourself so you need to provide evidence and it is ultimately up to a judge to decide\r\n15:27:35 kirstie: OK, so go with the letter before action next?\r\n15:27:43 Sam: Yes\r\n15:28:17 Sam: Do that and see how you get on, if you need any more help then come back to us. \r\n15:28:30 kirstie: ok thank you for your help\r\n15:28:47 Sam: No problem, have a great weekend\r\n15:28:58 kirstie: you too, thank you\r\n15:29:14 Sam: Goodbye\r\n'

How can I help you?\r\n14:49:50 Stephanie: Hello, I'm trying to find out if income from my partner's PhD stipend from a charitable trust would count as income, or income from a charitable trust - for universal credit?\r\n14:49:52 Stephanie: Thank you\r\n14:51:04 Stephanie: There seems to be conflicting advice, because other places say that a stipend would count, but then it is also from a charitable trust, which calculators have said to include in the charity sources section.\r\n14:54:08 Adam: Hi, sorry please just give me a moment. I'm just looking into this for you.\r\n14:54:20 Stephanie: Thank you\r\n15:00:39 Adam: Thanks for your patience. I assume the charitable trust is responsible for funding the research he is doing, and that they pay it for his living costs as a condition of continuing the research?\r\n15:03:04 Stephanie: Thank you, yes I should imagine those are the terms\r\n15:06:17 Adam: This kind of payment would usually be considered as income for UC purposes. Charitable payments are usually things such as reimbursement of travel expenses for volunteers, for example. You can certainly post a message in your UC journal highlighting this when you have claimed if you would like them to confirm this for you.\r\n15:07:46 Stephanie: Okay, thank you - I think the charity keeps those things seperate anyway so, it should be simply income. Thank you, very much\r\n15:07:53 Stephanie: Have a lovely day, Adam\r\n15:08:19 Adam: Thank you, have a nice weekend.\r\n""

How can I help you today?</span>\r\n14:13:55 Wendy Gallagher: I had a car on finance that was repossessed and sold in 2019. The car finance company then obtained an attachment of earnings which has been deducted at £250.00 for approx the last 18 months. I have been asking them for a breakdown because they say I still owe more than £4,000 and I am struggling to understand how and to keep paying. As it is I have to go without food regularly because I cant afford it. Is there anything I can do?\r\n14:20:46 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Thank you for sharing your issue with us.

Your employment status, housing type, who else lives with you?</span></span><br> \r\n14:32:05 Wendy Gallagher: I work full time and live alone in a shared house with other tenants. I have 2 grown up children who are both drug addicts.  I am at my wits end and cannot see a way out of this hardship.  I rarely have enough money for food after I have paid my bills and am struggling to carry on\r\n14:34:46 Jodie (FRN 617534): I understand you are worried Wendy, let\'s discuss what next steps might be best\r\n14:34:50 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>After you have paid for all your essential expenditure items (eg rent, council tax, fuel, water, groceries etc - but not payments to credit debts) how much money do you feel you have left?</span>\r\n14:35:15 Wendy Gallagher: I am actually minus about £50 each month\r\n14:36:46 Jodie (FRN 617534): <span>Thankyou. Do you own any assets?

Or are any of them joint debts?</span><br> \r\n14:43:15 Wendy Gallagher: yes and no, none are joint debts\r\n14:44:54 Jodie (FRN 617534): Okay thankyou. \r\n14:45:15 Jodie (FRN 617534): Do you know the total amount you owe with all of the creditors you mentioned?\r\n14:45:35 Wendy Gallagher: Around £8,000 I think\r\n14:47:29 Jodie (FRN 617534): Thankyou Wendy. I\'m just going to have to transfer you to another agent. I\'m sorry for the delay, it won\'t be a moment.\r\n14:48:02 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to Bethan (FRN 617534).\r\n14:48:12 info: You are now chatting with Bethan (FRN 617534).\r\n14:48:44 Bethan (FRN 617534): Hi Wendy, your speaking with Bethan, I\'ll just be a moment while I read through your chat is that okay? \r\n14:49:00 Wendy Gallagher: yes thats fine\r\n14:56:56 Bethan (FRN 617534): Okay Wendy so I understand you have rent arrears from a previous address, council tax arrears and mobile phone debt along with the debt from your hire purchase. What is it you are looking to achieve out of our call today?\r\n14:58:48 Wendy Gallagher: I do not believe the car finance company are acting fairly, surely the interest should have been capped when they took me to court. They have told me I still owe more than £4,000 and yet on Clearscore it says I owe £3,256.  I cannot afford to keep paying £250 per month, I do not have enough left to eat. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do\r\n15:02:52 Bethan (FRN 617534): Okay so there are 2 issues there, firstly you are looking to dispute the amount and then secondly you are looking to reduce the amount of the attachment of earnings is that correct?\r\n15:03:04 Wendy Gallagher: Yes\r\n15:03:48 Bethan (FRN 617534): Okay i\'ll just get some information for you with regards to this for you.\r\n15:04:02 Wendy Gallagher: Thank you\r\n15:06:49 Bethan (FRN 617534): So as my colleuge Jodie advised you can request a <span><span>Subject Access Request (SAR) from the company</span> using the following template letter  - <a href=""https://www.nationaldebtline.org/sample-letters/personal-information-under-data-protection-act/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.nationaldebtline.org/sample-letters/personal-information-under-data-protection-act/</a></span>\r\n15:07:49 Wendy Gallagher: I am aware of this but that does not answer my question, are they allowed to charge me the full amount of interest when they have taken me to court\r\n15:07:53 Bethan (FRN 617534): That will provide you with the breakdown of the figures, you can then contact the creditor and advise what payments you are disputing.  \r\n15:09:02 Wendy Gallagher: I know what I am disputing, its the position with regard to the interest\r\n15:15:36 Bethan (FRN 617534): Do you have a copy of your agreement as it would normally state that the interest payments would need to be paid. \r\n15:21:34 Bethan (FRN 617534): Hi are you still there?\r\n15:25:53 Bethan (FRN 617534): <span>You don\'t appear to be responding …..

Please note that I do not have the funds to pay a solicitor up front.

Were the books bespoke or made to order? \r\n14:56:18 Amanda: They replied that the item had actually been sent recorded delivery and then uploaded tracking information to ebay which shows that the parcel was sent recorded delivery and  delivered to my address on the 31st March\r\n14:57:04 Amanda: I then received notification from Ebay that my parcel had arrived (dated April 7)\r\n14:58:35 Amanda: And they said for me to see if my neighbours had taken reciept of the parcel and that they had asked Royal mail to investigate\r\n14:58:55 Amanda: The books are not made to order\r\n15:00:56 Natasha: Thank you. You may be able to argue that the contract has been breached. \r\n15:00:59 Natasha: <span>Under common law, when you enter into a contract, both parties are bound by any terms and conditions that have formed part of any pre-contract negotiations.</span>\r\n15:01:37 Natasha: <span>We would advise you to thoroughly read these to see what would happen if the contract couldn\'t be performed. </span>\r\n15:01:46 Natasha: <span>If nothing related to your issue is included in the terms and conditions, or, the trader is not following terms included, you may be able to hold the trader in breach of contract.</span>\r\n15:02:33 Natasha: <span>You may be able to seek a refund from the trader for a breach of contract by repudiating the contract; this means bringing the contract to an end. Alternatively, you may request the trader honour the contract as agreed and seek damages; damages could be for a monetary amount you feel is reasonable to compensate for the breach.</span>\r\n15:02:42 Natasha: <span>The burden of proof is on yourself as the consumer, therefore you will need to provide evidence if the trader is not complying with the terms and conditions. </span><br> \r\n15:03:56 Amanda: Ebay say I have to put in a denial of reciept with Royal Mail\r\n15:04:10 Natasha: This is the letter you can send to the trader. <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/wales/consumer/template-letters/letters/problems-with-services/letter-to-cancel-a-contract-thats-been-breached/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/wales/consumer/template-letters/letters/problems-with-services/letter-to-cancel-a-contract-thats-been-breached/</a></span>\r\n15:04:28 Natasha: <span>We recommend that you follow the trader’s complaints process. If they do not have a complaints process, then we advise to write to them. Explain what the problem is, how you would like them to sort it out and set a date for them to reply to you.<br><br>If you use webchat, it is a good idea to save a transcript of the conversation.<br><br>If you complain by post, send the letter using a recorded delivery service. This lets you track the letter, and prove it was sent and received.  An example of a recorded delivery service is Royal Mail Signed for. You can do this in any Post Office.<br>We advise to give them a deadline of 7-14 days to get back to you for a recorded delivery letter or 3-7 days for an email  </span>\r\n15:04:35 Natasha: <span>There is also a way you can solve disagreements without going to court - it is known as \'alternative dispute resolution\'. <br><br>Ask the trader if they are a member of an alternative dispute resolution scheme.

Are they allowed to do this? We have also given notice to our current landlord\r\n14:43:14 Helen Jolly: I know that there are some changes at the moment regarding renting because of covid and that the landlord of the new property can\'t evict them without 6 months notice\r\n14:44:13 Vincent: <span>Just in case we become disconnected or you need to contact us again regarding this or another issue I have assigned you a unique reference number, please keep this safe and quote it back to any of my colleagues you speak to in the future.

It makes an interesting case if both parties had agreed on the release, and then one party then decides to rescind that obligation. I will see if there is anything on our site about this situation.\r\n14:47:15 Helen Jolly: yes I am assuming so as the property was advertised on rightmove and the agent acting for the landlord carried out multiple viewings etc\r\n14:48:12 Helen Jolly: thank you, I am also interested int he converse as w ehave obviously given notice but it took us a long time to find somewhere new that was suitable and so I\'m worried now that I won\'t find something within my notice period\r\n14:50:30 Vincent: Please read this \r\n14:50:33 Vincent: <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/ending-your-tenancy/ending-your-tenancy/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/ending-your-tenancy/ending-your-tenancy/</a></span>\r\n14:51:40 Helen Jolly: i read this before contacting you, it doesn\'t really cover this scenario\r\n14:56:23 Vincent: You could contact <span><a href=""https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/security_of_tenure/notices_to_quit_tenants"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/security_of_tenure/notices_to_quit_tenants</a></span>\r\n14:56:42 Helen Jolly: thank you, I will do that\r\n15:00:46 Vincent: I have been looking at this issue, and as the tenant has made the decision to terminate the lease, and it was agreed with the landlord , it appears that it would need both parties to accept the decision. However in this situation I am not competent to give information or advise on this issie. It seems to be from reading the various articles that it is a civil law matter and as such would probably involve solicitors.\r\n15:01:02 Vincent: <span>Good luck, do come back to us if you need any more help.</span>\r\n15:02:20 Helen Jolly: thank you for looking in to it for me, I think from what the agent said to me that the landlord felt their only option was to give the tenant notice but because f the new covid rules this woudl be 6 months instead of the usual two, so perhaps the landlord considered it not worth the trouble to try and force the issue if you see what i mean\r\n15:02:34 Vincent: There is very little on the subject and the six months aspect seems to relate to when the landlord gives notice not the other way round.\r\n15:05:07 Vincent: From what you have said the tenants have withdrawn their notice to quit.  Covid regulations appear to protect the tenant where the landlord is forcing eviction.\r\n15:05:40 Vincent: However in saying that contact Shelter for further guidelines\r\n15:07:10 Vincent: <span>Can you withdraw a Break Notice? What should you, as landlord, do in the event that your tenant has served a break notice but subsequently decides they want to stay? Assuming that you are happy for them to remain in occupation and to continue paying rent, you might think it would be as straightforward as for both parties to agree, perhaps in writing, that the notice should be deemed withdrawn so that the lease continues as though the break had not been exercised. Surprisingly, this is not the case. In fact, once a break notice has been validly served it cannot be withdrawn; service of the notice effectively terminates the existing lease and creates a new tenancy by implication if the tenant remains in occupation past the break date (<em>Tayleur v Wildin (1867-68) LR 3 Ex 303).</em> This causes several issues: As the parties will not have followed the correct procedure for contracting out of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (the 1954 Act), the tenant is likely to automatically acquire security of tenure under their new lease. Any guarantor under the original lease would be released from their obligations thereunder and would not be a party to the new lease. If a rent deposit is held under the original lease, the terms of the deed may specify that it terminates at the end of the tenancy. Therefore, the landlord would not be able to draw down on the rent deposit to recover any arrears of rent under the new tenancy. Arguably, the tenant’s repairing obligations may be construed by reference to the condition of the premises at the date of the new lease (i.e. they will be released from liability for any disrepair caused prior to the new lease). If the rent under the previous lease was payable quarterly in advance, and the break date fell midway through a quarter, the tenant may be required to pay twice for the same remaining part of the quarter. <strong>So what is the best way forward?</strong> It may seem that the law as set out above prevents the landlord and tenant from achieving a sensible commercial outcome and creates an obstacle to implementing an agreement they have made. However, there are two simple solutions to the situation (one, as we will see, providing greater clarity in the situation than the other!): Do nothing. If there are pre-conditions (such as providing vacant possession of the premises, or making payment of all outstanding rent, for example), the parties can allow the notice to expire and deliberately fail to satisfy the pre-conditions, so that the break is not validly exercised. The dangers with this approach are that the landlord could waive compliance with the pre-conditions at any time, meaning the tenant’s lease will come to an end whether or not they have satisfied the pre-conditions. Equally, the tenant could decide to comply with the conditions and then the break will operate to determine the term. Any written agreement between the parties to co-operate will not be binding and could leave the other party high and dry. Document the new lease. This will ensure that the intentions of the parties are accurately recorded and if the lease is to be contracted out of the 1954 Act then the proper procedure can be followed. <strong>Are there any SDLT implications?</strong> Although the grant of a new lease would usually be subject to an SDLT charge, in this situation (even if a new lease is documented) HMRC will treat the original lease as ongoing and no charge will be payable. Do note though, that this is only the case where the lease rent, term and extent of the demise remain as per the original lease. If there are any changes to these terms, SDLT may be payable.</span>\r\n15:08:43 Vincent: <span>f your tenant does not leave the property You cannot remove your tenants by force. If the notice period expires and your tenants do not leave the property, you can start the process of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>eviction</a> through the courts.</span>\r\n15:09:29 Vincent: <span>Ok, we\'re all done.

Around November time? \r\n14:54:45 sharon abell: sorry just checking\r\n14:56:21 sharon abell: yes\r\n14:56:28 sharon abell: sorry\r\n14:56:58 sharon abell: but it seems because she needed to have furlough they were very off with her and now she owes 3 months wages\r\n14:57:04 sharon abell: thanks again for the advise\r\n14:57:31 Laura: For what reason are they saying she owes this money?\r\n14:59:40 sharon abell: it says i am highly disappointed you have taken the decision to leave us given that we agreed to put you back on payroll. (it was furlough) i would also note that if your decision is to leave in line with our agreement we will require 3 months CJRS salary back from you from date of going back on to payroll to present\r\n15:00:29 sharon abell: they did have email correspondance she agreed she may stay a month or so after furlough but this was not signed and the new company want her there. sorry can you advise?\r\n15:03:01 Laura: Thank you for confirming. I\'m just gathering some information.\r\n15:03:15 Laura: So when she was placed back onto the payroll (furlough) did she agree that she wouldn\'t leave/sign any contract to that effect? \r\n15:04:14 sharon abell: no they knew she was still going but agreed to stay for approx a month after the furlough,\r\n15:04:50 Laura: Nothing was signed though? No official agreements made? \r\n15:05:21 Laura: Your daughter is still entitled to be paid throughout her notice period so I\'m not sure why they\'d want the money back? \r\n15:05:21 sharon abell: nothing signed laura, she didnt see him face to face it was email correspondance\r\n15:05:58 sharon abell: i know thank you. do you know what we can do? he seems quite angry\r\n15:07:06 sharon abell: we are not sure what to respond with\r\n15:09:42 Laura: I just want to make sure I\'ve got all my ducks in a row. <br>Your daughter started working there last Aug and then handed her notice in roughly in November but they kept her on furlough. She\'s since mentioned leaving again and they\'re asking for 3 months of furlough payments back? \r\n15:13:14 sharon abell: ok thanks, so yes started last Aug. handed in her notice approx Nov when restaurants closed again but she was always leaving, it wasnt the case she was \'leaving again\'. they agreed to put her on furlough as long as she worked a bit there before moving on to the new place, but now the new place want her mid May. there were no signatures throughout this thanks\r\n15:16:00 Laura: Thank you - I won\'t be long, just going to look into this!\r\n15:16:12 sharon abell: thanks again and sorry i know you are busy\r\n15:18:36 Laura: It\'s certainly a complex situation, and quite unusual. As she is still employed she would likely need to raise a grievance with her employer if she disagrees with what they\'re saying:<br><br><span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/problems-at-work/dealing-with-grievances-at-work/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/problems-at-work/dealing-with-grievances-at-work/</a></span><br><br>If her contract states a three month notice period she is entitled to be paid for that; and also whilst on furlough she should have accrued any holiday as normal as well. <br> \r\n15:19:27 sharon abell: great thanks for this information very much appreciated, i will look at the link\r\n15:22:01 Laura: If there anything else that I can help you with at all? \r\n15:22:20 sharon abell: we will read through and action an email thanks again\r\n15:22:44 Laura: Do come back to us if you have any further questions.

Check to see if you can find a certificate of deposit, which will have been sent to them if they arranged for the will to be kept by the Principal Registry of the Family Division. Even if you can\'t find a certificate of deposit, you can still check with the Registry to see if they hold the will. If the person died in a care home or a hospital you could check to see if the will was left with them. You should also contact the person\'s solicitor, accountant or bank to see if they hold the will. The person who has died, or their solicitor, may have registered their will with a commercial organisation such as Certainty (<a href=""http://www.certainty.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>www.certainty.co.uk</a>) and, after the person\'s death, you can pay for a search of the wills registered on the company\'s database. You can also ask the company to contact solicitors in the area where the person lived to ask if they hold a will. If you can\'t find a will, you will usually have to deal with the estate of the person who has died as if they died without leaving a will.</span>\r\n14:45:04 Louise: Ok thanks I will try this xx means alot x\r\n14:45:51 Laura: If you do need further support you are more than welcome to come back to us or you can look to contact an organisation such as Cruse:<br><br><span><a href=""https://www.cruse.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.cruse.org.uk/</a></span>.\r\n14:46:06 Louise: No worries thanks again x\r\n14:47:17 Laura: Sending you best wishes and thank you for using our service today. \r\n'

Your reference is:  </span> <span>CL-104926378</span>\r\n14:43:37 Christina (FRN 617546): <span>Through this national webchat debt advice service I am able to provide information and guidance to help you deal with debts directly. However, if you like any extra support you can contact your local citizen’s advice. They may be able to direct you to local organisations who could help you.</span>\r\n14:43:50 Christina (FRN 617546): Are the loan and credit cards your only debts? \r\n14:44:06 Brian Sullivan: yes\r\n14:44:31 Christina (FRN 617546): okay, do you have any assets, like a car, property, savings, etc? \r\n14:46:36 Brian Sullivan: no we sold our house 2 years ago to try to clear debts but then covid came and I feel like we are back to square one\r\n14:47:01 Christina (FRN 617546): I understand, are these debts solely yours? \r\n14:47:13 Brian Sullivan: yes\r\n14:47:37 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay and do you have any debt with your current bank, like one of the credit cards? \r\n14:47:59 Brian Sullivan: no\r\n14:48:15 Christina (FRN 617546): Okay, <span>After you have paid for all your essential expenditure items (eg rent, council tax, fuel, water, groceries etc - but not payments to credit debts) how much money do you feel you have left?</span>\r\n14:49:37 Brian Sullivan: its never a set amount as I am self employed taxi driver and wages vary\r\n14:49:55 Christina (FRN 617546): No worries, a rough amount will do for now.\r\n14:52:03 Brian Sullivan: repayments on debt approx 600 pounds a month and at the moment I may have 250 a month spare\r\n14:54:32 Christina (FRN 617546): I see. So as you have a surplus you could look into an <span> individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). This is a formal insolvency options however, you pay monthly instalments to an IVA provider and  they would distribute that to your creditors. Having one monthly instalment may reduce your monthly expenditure. IVA\'s normally last around 5 years and you pay off a percentage of your debt, what ever isn\'t paid after the set amount of time is written off.

If they don\'t have a complaints process then email or write to them and send recorded delivery. Explain what the problem is, how you\'d like them to sort it out and set a date for them to reply to you 7-14 days is reasonable.<br><br>You can get help writing an email or letter by using the templates on our website <a href=""http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/template-letters/letters"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>here:</a>  There\'s also a way you can solve disagreements without going to court - it\'s known as \'alternative disupte resolution\'.<br><br>Ask the trader if they\'re a member of an alternative dispute resolution scheme.

I don\'t have an address for the company just an email address. I have emailed 4 times now the last one giving them 14 days as they would be in breach of a contract and nothing back from from.\r\n14:47:11 Amanda: It is very difficult to pursue a trader without an address as if no response to a letter the next step would be pursuing them in court and you cannot do this if you do not have an address for them. <br><br>Does clear pay have an address for the company ? \r\n14:48:44 Charlene: I can ask them but they aren\'t much help, if I\'m honest. They were meant to get back to me within 3 days, that was 2 weeks ago and nothing from them. I will get back on to clear pay. Just feel like I have no where to turn and not much help / luck getting my money back.\r\n14:48:55 Charlene: Thank you for your help.\r\n14:49:54 Amanda: It is very difficult without an address unfortunately,  <span>your reference number is – ZC<span>16578806</span> If you need any more help, get back in touch - you can chat with us again or give us a call on 08082231133.</span><br> \r\n14:50:06 Charlene: Thank you\r\n']"	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['nan']	['True' 'False']	['False' 'True']	['False' 'True']	['True' 'False']	['nan']	['False']	['nan']	['0']	['0']	['nan']	['0.0' '1.0' '-1.0' 'nan']	"['-7.0' '17.0' '77.0' '19.0' '42.0' '53.0' '-90.0' '-100.0' '-48.0' '0.0'

 ""I received a letter today from 'Easylife' claiming that I agreed to take their 'Supercard' discount card - trial cost £2.99 then annually automatically at £69.95. I have NOT signed up for anything. I made a one-off purchase from them last year - however last month they then debited £74.95 from my account. I reported this to my bank who credited my account with this sum and issued me a new bank card. The letter states that the subscription can be cancelled within the trial period of 14 days, it also states that the trial period ends on 23 March 2021 - almost a month ago. Is there any further action you would advise me to take?""

 ""In October 2017 I received a letter from Rightful Claims in Australia regarding an 'asset which appears to be lost, forgotten or unclaimed'.  They gave my full name and my former address that I moved from in 1993. I was very wary  so ignored the letter thinking it must be a scam.  They have now written to me  again, this time including the name of the company who apparently owes me money.  I did in fact have accounts with the said company but I thought I had received all the money due form the accounts when they matured.  They say I am owed £5,800.  Could this be legitimate?""

 ""Hello, my dignity Barbara Lapan. Some time ago my husband and I had a road accident, it was the other driver's fault, but they left right after the incident when I said that I would call the police, so my husband and I immediately went to the police and told everything and gave the registration numbers of this man. Immediately the information with the description of the event was sent to our insurer. After a few days, we had two options to choose from: How much will you get for your vehicle (Not Retaining)? Your vehicle's market value: £ 1,800.00 Your policy excess: £ 700 Total amount: £ n Your policy excess: £ 700 Salvage Deduction (30%): £ 540. It turned out when I called the police station where the report was, I received such information that it was a collision, but it is true that no one was hurt, but you escaped when I told you that I would call the police, and they tell me that you did not escape, but he left because he quotes and has it was on the paper from the Headquarters, the language barrier made it impossible, and it so happens that you probably didn't know because he escaped, but he and we are Poles and speak the same language. I also talked about it, I wrote about it, and the answer is that it is only a collision and the police do not find fault here, and the Lord was nice and willingly asked for his details. What should I do in this case? Choose any of the options and then appeal? Because I really do not know anymore, the company does not help, every day after 1.5 hours on the helpline, hundreds of e-mails, and we only hear what we choose?""

I just need guidance in regards to my housing situation.\r\n10:12:11 Mohammed: Morning t<span>his is Help to Claim.  I can only carryout a benefit check to see if you are entitled Universal credit or to any other benefits. </span>\r\n10:12:26 Mohammed: <span>Would you like to continue to see if you are eligible for any benefits to top up your income then transfer you to the generalist team </span>\r\n10:13:03 Mohammed: <span>In terms of data protection I just need to let you know that when we record and use your personal information we only access it when we have good reason, we only share what is necessary and relevant and do not sell it to commercial organisations. Is that okay?</span><br> \r\n10:13:12 Mohammed: <span>We also need your explicit consent to keep some information, known as special category data. This includes things like ethnicity, details of disability and health conditions, religion, sexual orientation, trade union membership. <br>For full details of how we collect and use your data read our [privacy policy](Link:https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/citizens-advice-privacy-policy/when-you-get-advice-from-an-adviser/). Do you consent to us using and storing any of the information outlined above or is there anything you would prefer us not to use and record?</span><br> \r\n10:13:43 You: Oh I connected with the universal credit team initially, explained that I have tried to contact the main advice line for some help with housing but have not yet successfully connected since yesterday. They said they would connect me to housing live chat.\r\n10:14:17 Mohammed: <span>Can I enquire if you are on any benefits currently</span>\r\n10:14:56 You: I am currently on a joint claim with my partner for universal credit as he is a low earner.\r\n10:15:19 Mohammed: can i ask when you made the claim\r\n10:15:21 You: We are just having problems getting housed with the council, that is what I am enquiring about today.\r\n10:15:43 Mohammed: i understand\r\n10:15:55 Mohammed: <span>Report a change of circumstances <br>• So you keep getting the right amount each month, you must report any changes.  Your claim might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change of circumstances straight away and Changes can include:<br>• finding or finishing a job<br>• having a child<br>• moving in with a partner<br>• starting to care for a child or disabled person<br>• moving to a new address<br>• changing your bank details<br>• your rent going up or down<br>• changes to your health condition<br>• becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach<br>• changes to your earnings (only if you’re self-employed)</span><br> \r\n10:16:31 Mohammed: <span>How often you’re paid by employer can affect your Universal Credit<br>If you’re paid once a month on the same date and nothing changes in your earnings, then your Universal Credit amount should stay the same.<br><br>Your Universal Credit can be affected if you receive more than one set of wages during some assessment periods. This could happen if:<br><br>• you’re paid weekly, every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks<br>• your monthly payment date changes, for example you get paid on the last working day of each month<br>• This means your earnings might be too high for Universal Credit. <br>• You’ll be told if they are and whether you’ll need to reapply to continue to get Universal Credit.</span><br> \r\n10:16:39 Mohammed: <span>I would like to make you aware how Universal credit deduction are made due to earned income. For each full £1 earned income this will reduces Universal total entitlement by £0.63p.<br><br>However you can retain some income before your UC entitlement is reduced. This is called a 'work allowance’. Therefore the size of the work allowance will be <br>• £292.00 as you have a child and the application includes the housing element <br>• £512.00 as you have a child and the application does not include  the housing element</span><br> \r\n10:16:55 Mohammed: i will transfer you\r\n10:17:01 You: Perfect thank you.\r\n10:17:08 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n10:17:13 info: You are now chatting with Tom.\r\n10:17:31 Tom: <span>Hello, you are through to the Consumer Advice Service and you are talking to Tom.</span>\r\n10:17:39 Tom: <span>Can you please confirm whether this is an issue related to your gas and/or electricity supplier?</span>\r\n10:17:57 You: Good morning Tom, I hope you are well. I am just looking for advice as I am having problems getting housed with the council.\r\n10:18:54 Tom: OK, for some reason you have been passed through to the Energy Team. What I can do is try and transfer you across to the right department. If you give me your postcode as well, I could get you the number for your Local Citizens Advice. \r\n10:19:20 You: M25 2NN, I would prefer to communicate via live chat due to anxiety.\r\n10:19:39 Tom: That's OK, I can try and pass you through to the right department instead. \r\n10:19:44 Tom: I'll be as quick as I can. \r\n10:19:57 You: Perfect, thank you Tom, much appreciated.\r\n10:20:13 Tom: No worries. \r\n10:20:36 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n10:20:36 Tom: Housing Advice Required\r\n10:21:32 info: You are now chatting with Mohammed.\r\n10:21:57 You: Hi Mohammed, I think I have just spoke with you?\r\n10:22:13 You: I was seeking help im regards to not being housed with council.\r\n10:22:21 Mohammed: <span>Have you used Citizens Advice before? If you have a reference number I can look up the details of your previous contact.</span>\r\n10:23:00 You: I spoke with you literally like two minutes ago\r\n10:23:09 You: I was then  connected to the wrong department\r\n10:23:22 Mohammed: sorry i will transfer you\r\n10:23:30 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n10:23:34 info: You are now chatting with Tom.\r\n10:23:49 You: Hi Tom, I was connected back to the wrong department .\r\n10:24:08 Tom: I passed you through to the general adviceline. \r\n10:24:25 Tom: If you bear with me, I'm going to speak to a manager to see if I can get you through to the right department. \r\n10:24:40 Tom: You said it was an issue with housing, would you be able to elaborate on that?\r\n10:26:35 You: So myself, partner and two dependant children are  currently living with my Mum. I have lived her since birth and my partner has lived here since May 2019. My Mum wanted us housed as soon as possible and she wrote a letter in connection with this.\r\n10:26:42 You: Here*\r\n10:27:05 You: We applied in September 2019, and have been highest priority now since January.\r\n10:27:08 Tom: Have you spoken to Shelter about this?\r\n10:27:32 Tom: They can provide advice on your rights and what you can do, plus they have a webchat feature so you wouldn't have to call them up. \r\n10:27:38 You: We was initally position 6th for a house and over the past months, we have gone to position 16th.\r\n10:28:18 You: We was advised to speak with CAB by our local MP.\r\n10:28:49 Tom: I understand that, but the general help department seem to have passed you to the Energy team so they may not be able to help. \r\n10:29:20 Tom: The other option would be to speak to your Local Citizens Advice, and I could get you their number, but I understand you have anxiety and might not want to speak on the phone. \r\n10:29:20 You: Mohammed said he was from universal credit help line.\r\n10:29:42 You: And that he would transfer me to the main advice help line.\r\n10:29:57 Tom: It might just be because there is a queue on the general helpline, so you are being bounced between Universal Credit and Energy, until those lines become free. \r\n10:30:20 Tom: I can try and transfer you again, if you want. \r\n10:30:39 You: Yes please. I have been trying since yesterday morning until end of play, and same today.\r\n10:31:39 Tom: Ok, I'll try again, but if it doesn't work I would recommend talking to Shelter who are housing specialists. Their website is <span><a href=""https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help</a></span>\r\n10:31:52 You: Perfect thank you\r\n10:32:05 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n10:32:05 Tom: Housing Issue, have tried to transfer to General but they got transferred back to Energy.\r\n10:32:11 info: You are now chatting with Stuart.\r\n10:33:01 You: Good morning Stuart, I hope you are well.

How much savings do you have?\r\n10:00:20 Rachael: 6000\r\n10:01:10 Ruth: 6000 exactly? or just over or just under?\r\n10:01:26 Rachael: Just under\r\n10:02:12 Ruth: I'm asking as £6000 is the threshold amount. If your savings are over £6000 any entitlement will reduce slightly \r\n10:02:46 Rachael: I believe it is under\r\n10:02:56 Rachael: but I can't find my book\r\n10:03:17 Ruth: its ok, I've put it in a £6000 exactly \r\n10:03:40 Rachael: ok\r\n10:04:20 Ruth: So based on what you have said today I have got that your entitlement to Universal Credit is £27.66 per week\r\n10:04:58 Ruth: I've also go that your entitled to £22.42 in council tax reduction per week\r\n10:06:53 Rachael: my circumstances changed ad in my rent got higher or I earn't more would it change\r\n10:07:05 Rachael: also how would I go about claiming this?\r\n10:11:24 Ruth: Yes it would change things. Universal credit works in real time so if your earnings changed to a higher or lower amount monthly your monthly UC payment would reflect this change. \r\n10:12:10 Rachael: I am not entitled to any housing benefit?\r\n10:12:39 Ruth: You said earlier that you had made your profile but didnt continue with it, when did you do this? <br>It would be best if you continued online but you can call the helpline number I gave you earlier. \r\n10:13:05 Rachael: Yes, I've taken that down\r\n10:13:18 Rachael: Thank you\r\n10:13:46 Rachael: You've been so helpful than you\r\n10:14:38 Ruth: So Universal Credit covers all benefits except for council tax reduction. what you think of now as Housing benefit would be covered in Universal Credit \r\n10:14:54 Rachael: The last thing that I wanted to do, was speak to someone about an application form I've signed in regards to a property\r\n10:15:38 Rachael: I see, thanks for the clarification\r\n10:15:56 Ruth: Ok, i can see if i can place you into a queue for generalist advice as i am just dealing with just universal credit issues\r\n10:16:05 Ruth: would this be ok with you?\r\n10:16:18 Rachael: That great, thank you so much\r\n10:17:26 Ruth: Your happy to look into your Universal credit applcation online? And you would need to get in touch with your local council for support with council tax reduction \r\n10:17:57 Rachael: Yes, I am or I will call the number you gave me.\r\n10:19:00 Ruth: Brilliant, good luck with everything and take care.<br>Again I will give you your client reference number just incase you need it in the future <span>CL-86819578</span><br>I will place you in a queue for generalist advice regarding your housing issues \r\n10:19:41 Rachael: Great, thank you!\r\n10:20:18 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n10:20:18 Ruth: Cl needs support regarding a housing document \r\n10:20:49 info: You are now chatting with Craig.\r\n10:21:13 Craig: Good Morning Rachael\r\n10:21:21 Rachael: Hi Craig,\r\n10:21:27 Craig: How can I help ?\r\n10:21:39 Craig: BTW: <span>You are able to request for the transcript of this chat to be sent you via email.

Can I please have your full name, address and DOB please?\r\n13:45:07 Gustavo Caje-Medina: and i was not able to chat with him\r\n13:45:11 Gustavo Caje-Medina: sure\r\n13:45:19 Gustavo Caje-Medina: my DOB is 12.06.1971\r\n13:45:26 Gustavo Caje-Medina: full name Gustavo Caje-Medina\r\n13:45:53 Gustavo Caje-Medina: address is 49 Roman Road, Basement Flat, London, E2 0HU\r\n13:46:41 Gustavo Caje-Medina: I walked to the local CAB to try to see someone but unfortunately the CAB was closed due to covid-19\r\n13:47:08 Zaineb (FRN 617659): Thank you. Your reference number with us is <span>CL-86140697</span>. I can see you had an appointment booked in, and I tried to call you about this but wasn't able to get through to you\r\n13:47:36 Zaineb (FRN 617659): To confirm you had mentioned you have a mixture of business and personal debts, is that right?\r\n13:48:01 Gustavo Caje-Medina: yes that is right personal and business\r\n13:49:16 Zaineb (FRN 617659): Unfortunately, as your ltd company is still running and because you do have a mixture of personal and business debts, Citizens Advice might not be best-placed to help in this particular situation. We can usually only advise on personal debts that are owed. Sometimes we can advise on business debts you are personally liable for, but because your business is still running and you have mentioned you're considering insolvency, it might be best for you to speak to Business Debtline for free specialist advice - they are best-placed to help where you have a mixture of the two types of debt: <span><a href=""https://www.businessdebtline.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.businessdebtline.org/</a></span>\r\n13:49:19 Zaineb (FRN 617659): They have a webchat too\r\n13:50:10 Gustavo Caje-Medina: Thanks... I will contact the business helpline later to see..\r\n13:50:20 Gustavo Caje-Medina: now my problem is my personal\r\n13:50:25 Gustavo Caje-Medina: my personal one...\r\n13:50:47 Zaineb (FRN 617659): Okay what is the issue please?\r\n13:50:52 Gustavo Caje-Medina: sure\r\n13:51:04 Gustavo Caje-Medina: i received a letter from the bank\r\n13:51:13 Gustavo Caje-Medina: saying that i need to pay them\r\n13:51:31 Gustavo Caje-Medina: 500 pounds give or take by wednesday 1st july\r\n13:51:38 Gustavo Caje-Medina: if i don't pay them\r\n13:51:55 Gustavo Caje-Medina: they will go to ""court"" or something similar...\r\n13:52:03 Gustavo Caje-Medina: so the deadline is wednesday\r\n13:52:34 Gustavo Caje-Medina: now, my wife left me on saturday with the only cash it was available...\r\n13:52:52 Gustavo Caje-Medina: it wasn't much but very important...\r\n13:52:58 Zaineb (FRN 617659): Okay. I can give you advice on this personal debt, but you will still need to speak to Business Debtline - meaning there would be two lots of advice, but Business Debtline can advise on both <span style=""font-weight:bold;"">personal</span> <span style=""font-weight:bold;"">and business </span>debts, so it might be a good idea to call them as soon as you possibly can. In the meantime, you will need to ask for a <span style=""font-weight:bold;"">hold on account</span> from the bank, and explain you are trying to get full advice\r\n13:53:09 Zaineb (FRN 617659): Under the consumer credit act, they should offer some flexibility.\r\n13:54:29 Gustavo Caje-Medina: okay i see... so i can ask for a ""hold on account""... do you have a link where I can look for some info... do i need to that by letter or going in person to the bank?\r\n13:55:36 Zaineb (FRN 617659): You can call the bank, or put that in an email, or write to them, whatever is easiest for you.

I have medication for severe chronic cluster headaches, they honestly so so debilitating and i  wasnt responsible, it wasnt in good faith\r\n09:13:04 Jan: Have you now blocked yourself from all these sites to make sure you do not use them in the future?\r\n09:13:40 Ben Ward: yes\r\n09:18:10 Jan: That's good to hear so you will not have a future problem. Regarding the return of monies: I cannot say if they will/not refund you but you can try and put your case (add in your mental health issues and medical evidence). You can contact each company direct-Customer Services-COMPLAINT DEPT and if you do not have a satisfactory response you can appeal to the Gaming Commission and ask they look into this for you. <span><a href=""https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Your-rights/Concern-about-a-gambling-business.aspx"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Your-rights/Concern-about-a-gambling-business.aspx</a></span>\r\n09:18:50 Ben Ward: the gambling commission said they wont help but il try again\r\n09:19:28 Jan: Mat I mention a word of caution they may not refund the monies if they accepted your bets in 'good faith' and were not at that time aware of your condition. \r\n09:20:05 Jan: I am sorry but this may be why they cannot offer a refund to you.\r\n09:20:25 Ben Ward: il try again and if they dont help then are you able to assist further if i come back to you\r\n09:20:35 Ben Ward: could you please email this transcript\r\n09:22:28 Jan: What was the Gambling Commission's response to you; their reasons why they cannot assist and what did the gaming sites reply to you as their reasons why they cannot offer a refund?\r\n09:24:01 Ben Ward: they said i jsut need to speak to the sites directly\r\n09:24:41 Jan: Thank you, have you done this? Were the sites aware of your medical condition before you placed the bets?\r\n09:25:00 Ben Ward: yes and i dont think so\r\n09:25:07 Ben Ward: they said they are a regulator and not an ombudsmen\r\n09:28:35 Jan: The IBAS are recommended by the Gaming Commission to resolve disputes. The sites may have a case in that they were not 'aware' at the time the bets were placed. It is worth contacting IBAS to ask they look into this for you. <span><a href=""https://www.ibas-uk.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.ibas-uk.com/</a></span>\r\n09:28:46 Ben Ward: sory i have to dash now, i will be here but wont be able to respond quickly\r\n09:28:53 Ben Ward: IBAS have also said they cant help with this\r\n09:31:13 Jan: You can have a transcript at the end of our chat by the way.

Is this because your employer is making you redundant?\r\n13:01:35 Vivien: Are you employed or self employed?\r\n13:01:49 Fatima: Selfemployed\r\n13:02:16 Fatima: I got a letter from them saying it ends 31st july\r\n13:02:35 Vivien: Ok, are you able to return to the work you were doing before?\r\n13:02:59 Fatima: No, there is no work!\r\n13:03:14 Fatima: I want to, but no work\r\n13:03:16 Vivien: Ok, what is it that you do?\r\n13:03:41 Fatima: Warehouse for Chanel\r\n13:04:02 Fatima: Distribution Assistant\r\n13:04:31 Vivien: Ok, so you have been classed as self employed since October 2018?Who wrote to you to advise the furlough scheme was ending?\r\n13:05:05 Fatima: Number Mill the ones that pay my wages\r\n13:07:11 Vivien: Ok, there seems to be some confusion because from what you are telling me you sound employed not self employed.It is important to establish which one as the advice you need will differ and also the documentation and process that you will need to follow and provide to claim UC.What does the letter you have received actually say?\r\n13:10:30 Fatima: I find all this very confusing, when all Corona started I phoned N.M. andask them what am I? 0 hour contract or selfemployed, and they told me selfemployed and started paying me furlough from April\r\n13:11:53 Vivien: You wouldn't get furlough pay if you were self employed as that scheme is only available to people classed as employed. How many payments have you had and how much have these been?\r\n13:13:25 Fatima: They started paying me week ending 10th April and ends 31 july\r\n13:13:39 Vivien: Ok, how often have you been paid?\r\n13:14:12 Fatima: Since April till July 17th\r\n13:14:32 Vivien: Ok, have you been getting paid monthly then?\r\n13:14:42 Fatima: Yes\r\n13:15:20 Vivien: Ok, in that case it does not sound like you are classed as self employed at all. Who advised you that you were self employed?\r\n13:15:41 Fatima: Number Mill\r\n13:15:57 Fatima: The ones that pay my wages\r\n13:16:15 Fatima: I think it's all wrong\r\n13:17:46 Fatima: They also opt out of Best on the 13th of July then enrolled me back in Nest on the 20th of July, and as far as I know this is illigal\r\n13:17:56 Fatima: Nest\r\n13:18:13 Vivien: How much have your payments been? What do you mean by NEST?\r\n13:18:35 Fatima: The pension schem\r\n13:19:17 Fatima: I got to know this when I received a welcome book and letter from Nest,\r\n13:20:11 Vivien: Do you pay National Insurance?\r\n13:20:48 Fatima: So I phoned Nest and ask them what's happening, they told me I oup out of Best and I enrolled again on the 20th, I said that I know nothing about this, so they told me to phone N.M.\r\n13:21:03 Fatima: Yes, I pay N. I.\r\n13:21:25 Fatima: Sorry Best not Best\r\n13:21:30 Fatima: Android\r\n13:21:37 Fatima: Nest\r\n13:22:01 Fatima: It changes by itself this android\r\n13:22:10 Vivien: Ok, it is sounding like you are employed but I think we need to get this clarified properly before we advise on UC. Are you due any payments in July?\r\n13:22:29 Fatima: No\r\n13:22:47 Fatima: They payed already on the 17th july\r\n13:23:00 Vivien: Ok, are you doing work via an agency?\r\n13:23:17 Fatima: Yes, called Fusion\r\n13:23:37 Vivien: Ok, have you a contract of employment?\r\n13:23:58 Fatima: It's all crazy\r\n13:24:30 Fatima: I register with Fusion, then the ones paying is N.M.\r\n13:25:01 Vivien: Ok, on your wage slip does this show deductions for National Insurance?\r\n13:25:25 Fatima: A few months back Fusion send a contract by post to fill in, because they had the Auditor\r\n13:25:40 Vivien: Ok,so have you signed a contract?\r\n13:25:53 Fatima: Yes it Shows deductions for National Insurance\r\n13:26:02 Fatima: I did\r\n13:26:14 Fatima: Send it by mail\r\n13:26:57 Vivien: Ok it does sound as though you are employed. Furlough isn't actually ending until November 2020 but employers will start to have to contribute towards the scheme if they want to use it as of August 2020.Has your employer told you not to come back to work?\r\n13:27:37 Fatima: This agency also don't pay holidays, they pay Attendance Bonus which I also don't understand\r\n13:28:23 Vivien: Ok, can i check something for you? I may be a few minutes?\r\n13:29:02 Fatima: They said if I could find 1,2 days a week work, they would then Carrie on with furlough, but there is no work\r\n13:29:10 Fatima: Yes\r\n13:35:42 Vivien: Ok, I am speaking with a supervisor about your case, we think that you need more specific employment advice. How do you find doing this over the telephone?\r\n13:36:08 Fatima: I can do it over the phone\r\n13:36:27 Fatima: What do I need to do\r\n13:38:57 Vivien: Ok, you can apply for UC and I can send you information on the basics for it but I think you need specialist advice regarding what is happening with your employer as it sounds like there are a number of issues you need more advice on. Until you have had this advice I can only give general information and advice on UC but you can come back to us for more specific advice once you have had the employment advice. Does that sound ok?\r\n13:40:18 Fatima: No\r\n13:40:27 Vivien: Ok why not?\r\n13:42:10 Fatima: I don't understand about the more specific advise, I can talk on the phone now, is that possible, because I'm already so confused, and yes I accept the information about UC\r\n13:42:16 Fatima: Thank you\r\n13:45:12 Fatima: Can I call you please and what's your number\r\n13:46:24 Vivien: Ok, I can't give you employment advice so I can either transfer the web chat to an employment adviser or give you a telephone number to call ACAS who are an independent organisation specialising in employment advice.The reason I can't give you full advice on UC today is that you need specialist advice to clarify and evidence what your employment status is. This is relevant to what you asked me at the start of the web chat today which was '<span>I need to apply for UC and I would like to know what documents I need.' The documents you will need to provide and process that has to be followed do differ depending on whether you are employed or self employed so this needs clarifying properly first as you are clearly experiencing issues around this and as you stated that this is confusing.</span>\r\n13:47:58 Fatima: Ok, so what do I do now?\r\n13:49:26 Vivien: So would you like me to send you the links for how to start a UC claim and then I can either transfer the web chat for employment advice or, if you would prefer phone advice, I  can give you the telephone number for ACAS. What would work best for you?\r\n13:51:40 Fatima: Please send me the links for U C, and the ACAS number please and I would like to be transferred to a web chat for employment advise\r\n13:52:07 Vivien: Ok, I will sort that now.\r\n13:52:17 Fatima: Thank you\r\n13:52:26 Vivien: <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/benefits-introduction/what-benefits-can-i-get/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/benefits-introduction/what-benefits-can-i-get/</a></span>\r\n13:52:38 Vivien: <span><a href=""https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/"" rel=""noopener"" target=_blank>https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/</a></span>\r\n13:53:01 Vivien: <span><strong>Acas early conciliation team</strong> Telephone: 0300 123 1122<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm</span>\r\n13:53:31 Vivien: Is there anything else that I can help you with today before I transfer you for employment advice?\r\n13:54:21 Fatima: No,  and thank you so much for your help\r\n13:55:38 Vivien: You're very welcome. If you need more advice on UC once you have had the employment advice please do get back in touch and if you use the client number I gave you at the start of the web chat we will be able to pick up where we left off. I hope you get things resolved soon.\r\n13:56:58 Fatima: Thank you, do I wait for you to transfer me now\r\n13:57:53 info: Please wait while your chat is transferred to the appropriate group.\r\n13:57:53 Vivien: Client needs advice on whether she is employed or self employed and if employed whether the actions being undertaken by her employer are correct, in particular with realtion to holiday pay, her pension and furlough.\r\n13:59:05 info: You are now chatting with Shirley.\r\n13:59:19 Shirley: Good afternoon\r\n13:59:24 Shirley: <span>Have you used Citizens Advice before?

Is that correct?\r\n14:05:34 Fatima: I just need to solve what I don't understand and Vivien transferred me to you the right person to help\r\n14:06:33 Shirley: I am a general advisor not an employment specialist.  I may be able to help you.  You are trying to find out whether you are self employed or not, is that correct?\r\n14:08:40 Fatima: Well I don't know, I would like someone that really understands what's going on to help me please, because I did phone N.M. on the bigining of Corona asking if I am 0hour contract or selfemploye, they told me that I am selfemploye\r\n14:10:52 Shirley: Do you have a contract of employment with them?\r\n14:11:04 Fatima: I do\r\n14:11:17 Fatima: Everything was done online\r\n14:11:19 Shirley: Who does it say is your employer?\r\n14:13:05 Fatima: I register with an agencie called Fusion,  then we started getting payed by N.M. I then phone one time to Fusion to find out who is Number Mill, and they told me that Fusion gets the jobs and N.M. pays the wages\r\n14:13:32 Shirley: So it sounds like you might be an agency worker?\r\n14:13:41 Fatima: Yes\r\n14:13:45 Fatima: I am\r\n14:13:58 Shirley: The contract is with the agency then, not NM - is that correct?\r\n14:14:08 Fatima: Yes\r\n14:14:18 Fatima: As far as I understand\r\n14:18:04 Fatima: Hello Shirley\r\n14:18:29 Shirley: Can I clarify what your questions are for me - I can see someone has already given you details for ACAS.\r\n14:18:49 Fatima: Yes\r\n14:19:31 Fatima: I was supposed to be transferred to ACAS\r\n14:19:55 Fatima: I don't know\r\n14:20:18 Shirley: We cannot transfer you to ACAS.  You were given details of how to contact them by the previous person you spoke to.  You would have to end the chat with us and contact them direct\r\n14:20:47 Shirley: <span><strong>Acas early conciliation team</strong> Telephone: 0300 123 1122<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm</span>\r\n14:21:01 Fatima: So I don't understand why I was btransfered to you\r\n14:21:01 Shirley: These are the contact details you were given\r\n14:21:31 Fatima: Can you please tell me why I was then transferred to you?\r\n14:21:50 Shirley: I believe the previous advisor gave you details for ACAS for you to contact them but also said they could transfer you to someone at Citizens Advice who may be able to help you with employment issues as well.\r\n14:22:07 Fatima: Yes\r\n14:22:32 Fatima: And i was expecting that\r\n14:23:07 Shirley: You are still speaking to Citizens Advice at the moment.

What brings you to our site today?</span>\r\n08:07:18 Vikki: i can see from the conversation above you were wondering about the impact on benefits if your husband took more hours is this correct?\r\n08:07:29 Aishah: I needed some information so basically at the moment i have a joint child tax credits claim and my husband works 16 hours.

Please bear with me for a minute or so while I read the previous  notes.</span>\r\n08:11:33 Aishah: Ok\r\n08:14:52 Simon: OK so you're on Tax Credits now and your husband's job/hours are changing and you're asking if that's a change of circumstances that will require you to move to Universal Credit? \r\n08:15:01 Simon: Is that right? \r\n08:15:07 Aishah: Yes\r\n08:16:19 Simon: And that's the only change yes?\r\n08:16:46 Aishah: Yes change of job and possibly hours up tp 30\r\n08:16:52 Aishah: He hasnt changed it yet\r\n08:17:56 Simon: You should just report the change to Tax Credits as/when it happens as the change in income is likely to be sufficient for them to change your award 'in year'. \r\n08:19:04 Simon: Normally Tax Credits are assessed based on income in the last tax year and adjusted later if there are changes. \r\n08:19:26 Simon: Danger of that is overpayments. \r\n08:20:05 Simon: You should be OK from that point of view if you report the change as soon as he starts the new job. \r\n08:20:34 Aishah: Ok thank you\r\n08:21:09 Simon: It looks as though you did not want us to retain your details. \r\n08:21:14 Simon: Is that right? \r\n
